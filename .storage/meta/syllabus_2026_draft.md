### **PUFY 1263: Emergent Objects**

**Spring 2026 | Monday, 12:10 PM – 2:50 PM**
**Location:** Parsons 2 W 13th #1013
**Instructor:** Ariel Churi | **Office Hours:** By appointment before or after class.

---

### **I. Course Description**

Program, fabricate, and document electronic objects to build a better future. Students gain an understanding of tactile, human-computer interfaces by producing evocative and functional devices. The course covers electrical engineering fundamentals, circuit design, basic Python coding, and working with microcontrollers to create responsive, research-based designs.

---

### **II. Learning Outcomes**

By the successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

1.  **Critical Thinking:** Critically reflect on how the design and function of an electronic object challenge societal values or ecological sustainability.
2.  **Tools, Materials, Methods:** Write and debug basic Python code and create electronic circuits using microprocessors.
3.  **Experimentation:** Play with the concept of a "fantastic object" and experiment with non-traditional human-object interactions through play and discovery.
4.  **Discipline Specific:** Apply design research methodologies and analyze user behaviors to develop detailed personas and user journeys.
5.  **Broad Application:** Use speculative scenarios to inspire creative problem-solving across art, design, and strategic thinking fields.
6.  **Life:** Reflect on personal responsibility and self-understanding through the creation of objects that respond to a utopian or dystopian future.
7.  **Reflection:** Document their process and reflect on their learning via the **Parsons Learning Portfolio**.

**Grading Rubric Criteria:**

- **40% Class Participation:** Includes regular attendance, active contribution to critiques, and timely submission of in-class exercises and Learning Portfolio posts.
- **60% Projects:** Evaluated based on creative problem-solving, documentation of research, and technical improvement.

| Grade       | Criteria                                              |
| :---------- | :---------------------------------------------------- |
| **A (4.0)** | Exceptional quality; goes beyond stated goals;        |
|             | technically and creatively rigorous.                  |
| **B (3.0)** | Very good work; satisfies all course goals and        |
|             | demonstrates clear understanding.                     |
| **C (2.0)** | Average work; indicates basic understanding but       |
|             | lacks depth or polish.                                |
| **F (0.0)** | Failure to meet the basic requirements of the course. |

### **V. Class Policies**

- **Attendance:** **Attendance will be taken at the start of every class** to encourage punctuality. More than three absences (20% of the term) may lead to failure.
- **Electronic Devices:** Permitted only when used for course-related work (coding, research); all other uses are prohibited.
- **AI Policy:** Students may use AI as a learning assistant to clarify code or brainstorm, but **no final work (text, code, or images) generated by AI may be submitted** as your own without written permission.

---

**Analogy for Students:** Building an emergent object is like learning to cook a complex meal: first, you must understand your ingredients (electricity), then master the techniques (coding), and finally, present a dish that tells a story about the world you want to live in.
