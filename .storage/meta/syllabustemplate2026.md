# **Course Description**

\[Faculty, please add the course description listed in the New School Course Catalog: [https://courses.newschool.edu/\]](https://courses.newschool.edu/%5D)

# **Learning Outcomes**

By the successful completion of this course, students will be able, at **an introductory level,** to:

1. Insert Learning Outcome related to **critical thinking** – define a thinking capacity in relation to the topics students will learn.

2. Insert Learning Outcome specific to the **tools, materials, methods** of the course- define one essential procedure to be learned. 

3. Insert Learning Outcome related to **experimentation** – how will this elective allow for play, experimentation and discovery as a path to learning.

4. Insert Learning Outcome related to **discipline specific learning** – define a proto-skill related to the art, design, or strategic thinking field that students will learn.

5. Insert Learning Outcome related to **broad application of learning** – define an understanding students will learn about the relationship between this course and other disciplines, interdisciplinary potential?

6. Insert Learning Outcome **related to life** \- define a way in which students' understanding of the topics is related to relevant “big ideas” (philosophical, social, ecological, etc) or an understanding of self.

7. Students will learn to reflect on their own learning in posts on the Parsons Learning Portfolio. *Note to faculty: As stated in this LO the use of the Learning Portfolio as a tool for reflection is necessary in your course. Please make sure to reflect how this will be accomplished in the Assessable Tasks.* 

# **Weekly Outline**

# ***Note to Faculty (Delete red text after reading):***

**Course Format**

**This course is an in-person course** and the vast majority of class sessions take place in our classrooms and in the city. Faculty may design their course to **have 1 individual class session meet online where appropriate, but faculty do not have permission to switch their in-person courses to fully online for a portion of the semester.** 

If you choose to add a pre-planned online session, consider the following moment:

* Mid-term Check-in  
    
  **This session must be highlighted within the syllabus prior to submitting your draft.**   
    
  **Week 8**

  The First Year Program asks all faculty to include a mid-term check-in for the week 8 class sessions. This gives you time to provide each student with a detailed and clear assessment of their progress in the course. 

  Students should have up-to-date grades by the mid-term and a clear sense of their standing in the class. Faculty will also continue to fill out the Starfish Survey, written as a message directly to the student, for any needed follow-up with advising or other student support offices. 

  We recommend using class time during week 8 to **allow students to catch up, receive feedback, and also allow students to attend other programmed activities.**

  **University Breaks (Thanksgiving & Spring Break)**


  **University Breaks (Thanksgiving & Spring Break)**

  Please note that First Year courses DO NOT assign homework over Thanksgiving and Spring break to allow students to visit family, travel, etc. In some cases however, a faculty might ask a student who needs to catch up on coursework to use this time accordingly.

# **Assessable Tasks** Assessable Tasks are activities, assignments, projects that satisfy the course's learning outcomes.

# **To be entered by faculty. This is a summary of the types of tasks that are linked to the learning outcomes. Please refer to [this presentation for a detailed guide on how to create your Assessa ble Tasks](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12gY0FjqW-ignaB9CHiaLQiJwa3lfg2klIfW1q7wLUyY/present). Include materials to be used for each project.** 

# **Learning Portfolio**

**Please Read before deleting:** Studio faculty are responsible to introduce the LP during the first day of class. This can be made pointing students to the resources existing on canvas or guiding them as they create their first post in the learning portfolio. All students should have their LP set up when they come to your class, if they don’t please refer them to IT to resolve the issue. 

You will use the Parsons Learning Portfolio throughout your education at Parsons. It is an ongoing, cumulative repository for your creative development and experience across courses, and across years. It archives your working process, skills learned, and connections you make between assignments, courses, and years, as well as final “finished” work. The courses in the first year emphasize the process – how you started, what happened next (and why), and how you ended up at your final work for each project. 

Showing preliminary work (sketches, drafts, notes, research, etc.) as well as final documentation of your work will help to tell your story and make connections that may not have otherwise been apparent. In Integrative Seminar and Studio, the Parsons Learning Portfolio will serve as a bridging mechanism to aid conversation and provide access to projects and writings across the seminar and studio, and stimulate critically reflective learning, thinking, writing and making.

**Make sure to use the MANDATORY Parsons Learning Portfolio Template**\- and do not change the template as this is a shared component of the Parsons experience. Also please **add a Learning Portfolio link to your [Canvas Bio](http://guides.instructure.com/m/4212/l/75098?data-resolve-url=true&data-manual-id=4212).** This allows fellow students and faculty to access your portfolio.

# **Materials and Supplies**

Please note that there are materials costs associated with this studio course and you should expect to purchase up to $... (discuss this amount with the coordinator) on supplies. The expected cost does not include printer points that you receive as a student, nor does it include the materials from the materials kit that is purchased as you enter the first year. You can find a list of the materials kit items on the First Year advising page: [http://www.newschool.edu/parsons/academic-advising-first-year-students/](http://www.newschool.edu/parsons/academic-advising-first-year-students/)

- List any additional supplies that you require for your course here, being mindful of the $... limit.  
- Note the materials that your students will use that are included as part of the First Year Material kit.   
- Do not duplicate these kit materials (for example a different brand of an item that is already included in the kit) as this can be costly for students.

**Learning Together/Community Agreement**  
At the beginning of the semester students and faculty will work together to establish a common culture/approach for learning together that could take the form of Community Agreements. As you prepare for this process is important for you to review the following statements: 

* [**CURRICULAR JUSTICE ACKNOWLEDGMENT STATEMENT**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14V-8ZIv2iLAY23y2WNBeHAHvZhaUU00bsG9txSAhl4Y/edit?usp=sharing)  
* [**STATEMENT ON DIVERSITY, EQUITY & INCLUSION**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kuMJ6carMfWwjPEiSnm7FUKNn2U0hOwG3T6r0ZNMpac/edit?usp=sharing)  
* [**PRONOUNS STATEMENT**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G2MvyMR9jLRjMuM_FDHVZp6LIpWn_ycGzny9UZyRYoc/edit?usp=sharing)

This course Community Agreements and Guidelines to Learning Together are: 

Faculty please add guidelines for your classroom community. You may add your own guiding principles, or invite students to build a set of understandings with you on the first day of class that can be added to the syllabus or Canvas and referenced during the semester. 

# Community agreements, sometimes called ground rules, invite faculty and students to work together in building an inclusive classroom, allowing for thoughtful and open dialogue while setting a tone of respect and responsibility. For more information on Community Agreements from The New School Faculty Center, [link here](https://sites.google.com/a/newschool.edu/faculty-professional-development-network/home/announcements/communityagreementsforinclusiveclassrooms).

# **Grading and Evaluation**

Students’ ability to meet the course’s learning outcomes will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

* Attend regularly and communicate any challenge or absences to their faculty  
* Solve problems, both creative and technical through an iterative process  
* Turn in project assignments and course material on time  
* Document their research in the development of projects  
* Describe the the cross-course exploration between the Studio and Seminar  
* Participate in class discussions and critiques  
* Be accountable in collaborative work  
* Improve in technical, creative, and problem solving abilities  
* Submit thoughtful studio works that have undertaken several stages of ideation.

## **About Attendance and Grading**

**Please include a detailed explanation of your Attendance and Participation Policy.** You are welcome to use [**The FY Recommended Attendance and Participation Policies Language**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10ynyJk92QCwvysZ7dyRVXR2uLJAJdtxuKNn11cXfZcA/edit?usp=sharing). 

(For more information on attendance see the University Policies below)

**To Faculty**:  
Students should be assessed fully and comprehensively against all measures outlined in the course syllabus, including participation. The following grade calculation example frames Class Participation, which includes attendance and meeting due dates, as 40% of the overall grade, further validating the importance of students’ active engagement in each step of the learning process. 

Faculty must use Starfish (Student Success Network) to track students’ attendance and to document concerns. PLEASE NOTE: Frame your comments in the starfish flag as if you are speaking WITH the student- *NOT about* the student. Think of the flag as an email directly for the student that is productive and visible by advising and other staff who can support the student.

**UNIVERSITY POLICY & RESOURCES**

**Resources**  
The university provides many resources to help students achieve academic and artistic excellence. These resources include:

* [**The University (and associated) Libraries**](https://library.newschool.edu/)  
* [**The University Learning Center**](https://www.newschool.edu/university-learning-center/)  
* [**University Disabilities Service**](https://www.newschool.edu/student-disability-services/)**s**  
  *In keeping with The New School's policy of providing equal access to individuals with disabilities, instructors are strongly encouraged to include a statement on their syllabus informing students that academic accommodations can be provided on the basis of disability if the student follows the protocol described. The following statement contains all of the elements that should be present. Instructors may want to make changes based on style preference or particular course content. Students Disability Services (SDS) assists students with permanent or temporary disabilities in need of academic and programmatic accommodations as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) and Section 504 of the Federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973\.*

  In keeping with the university's policy of providing equal access for students with disabilities, any student with a disability who needs academic accommodations must contact SDS. There are several ways for students to contact the office: via email at StudentDisability@newschool.edu, through the Starfish service catalog, or by calling the office at 212.229.5626. A self-ID form can also be completed on the SDS webpage at www.newschool.edu/student-disability-services. Once you contact the office, SDS staff will arrange an intake appointment to discuss your concerns and, if appropriate, provide you with accommodation notices to give to me. Please note that faculty will not work unilaterally with students to provide accommodations. If you inform me of a disability but do not provide any official notification, I must refer you to SDS.


* [**Making Center**](http://resources.parsons.edu/)  
  The Making Center is a constellation of shops, labs, and open workspaces that are situated across the New School to help students express their ideas in a variety of materials and methods.  We have resources to help support woodworking, metalworking, ceramics and pottery work, photography and film, textiles, printmaking, 3D printing, manual and CNC machining, and more. A staff of technicians and student workers provide expertise and maintain the different shops and labs. Safety is a primary concern, so each area has policies for access, training, and etiquette with which students and faculty should be familiar. Many areas require specific orientations or training before access is granted.  
* [**Health and Wellness**](https://www.newschool.edu/campus-community/health-wellness-support/): additional services and support available to New School students.

**Grading Standards**  
What follows is Parsons’ grading standards. You should articulate your own policy for work taking other forms (e.g. presentations, critiques, visuals). Use clear criteria, specifying how both you and your students will know whether they have achieved the learning outcomes. The full grading policies and procedures may be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A-hrYe6GI5GbbGhxoDxlBMPrNtlGL06hEmWRA-PGp7M/edit?usp=sharing). 

**Undergraduate**  
A student’s final grades and GPA are calculated using a 4.0 scale.

A  \[4.0\] 	Work of exceptional quality, which often goes beyond the stated goals of the course (95-100%)  
A- \[3.7\] 	Work of very high quality (90% \- \<95%)  
B+ \[3.3\]	Work of high quality that indicates higher than average abilities (87% \- \<90%)  
B  \[3.0\] 	Very good work that satisfies the goals of the course (83% \- \<87%)  
B- \[2.7\] 	Good work (80% \- \<83%)  
C+ \[2.3\]	Above-average work (77% \- \<80%)  
C  \[2.0\] 	Average work that indicates an understanding of the course material; passable (73% \- \<77%);   
Satisfactory completion of a course is considered to be a grade of C or higher.  
C- \[1.7\] 	Passing work but below good academic standing (70% \- \<73%)  
D  \[1.0\] 	Below-average work that indicates a student does not fully understand the assignments (60% \- \<70%); Probation level though passing for credit  
F  \[0.0\]	Failure, no credit (0% \- \<60%)  
GM	Grade missing for an individual

**Grade of W**  
The grade of W may be issued by the Office of the Registrar to a student who officially withdraws from a course within the applicable deadline. There is no academic penalty, but the grade will appear on the student transcript.  
    
**Grades of Incomplete**   
The grade of I, or temporary incomplete, may be granted to a student under unusual and extenuating circumstances, such as when the student’s academic life is interrupted by a medical or personal emergency. This mark is not given automatically but only upon the student’s request and at the discretion of the instructor. A Request for Incomplete form must be completed and signed by the student, instructor and program director. The time allowed for completion of the work and removal of the “I” mark will be set by the instructor with the following limitations: \[You should include one of the following standards, depending on the level of your course\].

**Undergraduate students:** Work must be completed no later than the seventh week of the following fall semester for spring or summer term incompletes and no later than the seventh week of the following spring semester for fall term incompletes. Grades of “I” not revised in the prescribed time will be recorded as a final grade of “F” by the Registrar’s Office. 

**College, School, Program and Class Policies**  
You should include the following headings with the recommended text. Any policy specific to your class must also be clearly written in the syllabus. For example, many instructors create their own policies to cover a variety of classroom situations, such as late assignments, rewrites and extra credit; the use of cellphones, laptops, and other technology in the classroom; your expectations should you be delayed, or makeup exams/absence on exam days. 

A comprehensive overview of policy may be found under [Policies: A to Z](https://www.newschool.edu/about/university-resources/policies/). Students are also encouraged to consult the [Academic Catalog for Parsons](https://www.newschool.edu/provost/academic-catalogs/). 

**Canvas**  
Use of Canvas may be an important resource for this class. Students should check it for announcements before coming to class each week.  
   
**Electronic Devices**   
The use of electronic devices (phones, tablets, laptops, cameras, etc.) is permitted when the device is being used in relation to the course's work. All other uses are prohibited in the classroom and devices should be turned off before class starts.

**Responsibility**   
Students are responsible for all assignments, even if they are absent. Late assignments, failure to complete the assignments for class discussion and/or critique, and lack of preparedness for in-class discussions, presentations and/or critiques will jeopardize your successful completion of this course.  

**Active Participation and Attendance**  
Class participation is an essential part of class and includes: keeping up with reading, assignments, projects, contributing meaningfully to class discussions, active participation in group work, and attending synchronous sessions regularly and on time.

Parsons’ attendance guidelines were developed to encourage students’ success in all aspects of their academic programs. Full participation is essential to the successful completion of coursework and enhances the quality of the educational experience for all, particularly in courses where group work is integral; thus, Parsons promotes high levels of attendance. Students are expected to attend classes regularly and promptly and in compliance with the standards stated in this course syllabus. 

While attendance is just one aspect of active participation, absence from a significant portion of class time may prevent the successful attainment of course objectives. A significant portion of class time is generally defined as the equivalent of three weeks, or 20%, of class time. Lateness or early departure from class may be recorded as one full absence. Students may be asked to withdraw from a course if habitual absenteeism or tardiness has a negative impact on the class environment.

I will assess each student’s performance against all of the assessment criteria in determining your final grade. \[Students are expected to keep up with class activities and requirements each week. Also, describe additional expectations for meaningful participation. If students are unable to join synchronous sessions, how will they access the content and materials covered during the session so that they can keep up and “make-up” this absence? How will faculty and students interact on Zoom? Use the chat feature? Etc.\]

**Recording Synchronous Sessions**  
Faculty should describe if they have plans for recording. Guidelines for recording synchronous sessions can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/175x8O110AkTBLuxCE_C_cfHIpyq9-U0UOt_j2w9zEVA/edit?usp=sharing).

**Using AI and generative tools in Parsons First Year**  
Please note that the use of Artificial Intelligence and generative text and image tools are  
addressed in [the New School statement on Student Academic Integrity.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/175hXxUbLI8Jy7NEtbeoyX3Va_MQzXzgxzFUjj7hSkSU/edit) As a general rule please consider the following with regards to AI: 

* Do not submit any final work \- writing or images \- generated by AI tools without written permission from your faculty.  
* AI tools deliver results that have been synthesized and averaged from many non citable sources. Misrepresentations are easy to miss.  
* The AI tech space is rapidly changing and will continue to be contested. Be discerning in how you use these tools.  
* Remember why you are at Parsons \- to invest in yourself as a creative.  Explore these tools with curiosity and criticality, rather than dependency.

**Faculty Specific policy about the use of AI and generative tools**   
Include any guidelines or policies for your class here. We recommend reviewing the examples of syllabus statements about AI included in the [Guide to Faculty Teaching and Learning.](https://guidetoteaching.newschool.org/generative-artificial-intelligence/)

**Academic Honesty and Integrity**  
Compromising your academic integrity may lead to serious consequences, including (but not limited to) one or more of the following: failure of the assignment, failure of the course, academic warning, disciplinary probation, suspension from the university, or dismissal from the university.

Students are responsible for understanding the University’s policy on academic honesty and integrity and must make use of proper citations of sources for writing papers, creating, presenting, and performing their work, taking examinations, and doing research. It is the responsibility of students to learn the procedures specific to their discipline for correctly and appropriately differentiating their own work from that of others. The full text of the policy, including adjudication procedures, is found on the university website under [Policies: A to Z](https://www.newschool.edu/about/university-resources/policies/). Resources regarding what plagiarism is and how to avoid it can be found on the [Learning Center’s website](https://www.newschool.edu/learning-center/resources-workshops/).

The New School views “academic honesty and integrity” as the duty of every member of an academic community to claim authorship for his or her own work and only for that work, and to recognize the contributions of others accurately and completely. This obligation is fundamental to the integrity of intellectual debate, and creative and academic pursuits. Academic honesty and integrity includes accurate use of quotations, as well as appropriate and explicit citation of sources in instances of paraphrasing and describing ideas, or reporting on research findings or any aspect of the work of others (including that of faculty members and other students). Academic dishonesty results from infractions of this “accurate use”. The standards of academic honesty and integrity, and citation of sources, apply to all forms of academic work, including submissions of drafts of final papers or projects. All members of the University community are expected to conduct themselves in accord with the standards of academic honesty and integrity. Please see the complete policy in the Parsons Catalog.

**Intellectual Property Rights**  
The New School (the "university") seeks to encourage creativity and invention among its faculty members and students. In doing so, the University affirms its traditional commitment to the personal ownership by its faculty members and students of Intellectual Property Rights in works they create. The complete policy governing Intellectual Property Rights may be seen on the [university website, on the Provost’s page](https://www.newschool.edu/provost/accreditation-policies/).

**Student Course Ratings (Course Evaluations)**  
During the last two weeks of the semester, students are asked to provide feedback for each of their courses through an online survey. They cannot view grades until providing feedback or officially declining to do so. Course evaluations are a vital space where students can speak about the learning experience. It is an important process which provides valuable data about the successful delivery and support of a course or topic to both the faculty and administrators. Instructors rely on course rating surveys for feedback on the course and teaching methods, so they can understand what aspects of the class are most successful in teaching students, and what aspects might be improved or changed in future. Without this information, it can be difficult for an instructor to reflect upon and improve teaching methods and course design. In addition, program/department chairs and other administrators review course surveys. Instructions are available online [here.](#during-the-last-two-weeks-of-the-semester,-students-are-asked-to-provide-feedback-for-each-of-their-courses-through-an-online-survey.-they-cannot-view-grades-until-providing-feedback-or-officially-declining-to-do-so.-course-evaluations-are-a-vital-space-where-students-can-speak-about-the-learning-experience.-it-is-an-important-process-which-provides-valuable-data-about-the-successful-delivery-and-support-of-a-course-or-topic-to-both-the-faculty-and-administrators.-instructors-rely-on-course-rating-surveys-for-feedback-on-the-course-and-teaching-methods,-so-they-can-understand-what-aspects-of-the-class-are-most-successful-in-teaching-students,-and-what-aspects-might-be-improved-or-changed-in-future.-without-this-information,-it-can-be-difficult-for-an-instructor-to-reflect-upon-and-improve-teaching-methods-and-course-design.-in-addition,-program/department-chairs-and-other-administrators-review-course-surveys.-instructions-are-available-online-here.)
