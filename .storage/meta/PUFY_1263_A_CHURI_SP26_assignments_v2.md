## Assignment Overview

This course includes a series of scaffolded assignments designed to build your skills progressively throughout the semester. Each assignment contributes to your final project: a functional electronic object designed for a speculative future scenario. Assignments are intentionally kept manageable to allow you to focus on learning fundamentals while exploring creative possibilities.

## 1. Lab Safety Orientation
**Due:** Week 3 (Feb 9)
**Weight:** Mandatory/ungraded 

Complete the Making Center safety orientation to gain access to lab equipment, soldering stations, and fabrication tools. This is required before you can use any Making Center facilities.

**Deliverable:** Confirmation of completed orientation

## 2. Utopia/Dystopia World & User Persona
**Due:** Week 2 (Feb 2) — Initial draft
**Due:** Week 7 (Mar 23) — Final version (integrated with User Journey)
**Weight:** 10% (combined with User Journey)

Create a speculative future scenario (utopian or dystopian) and develop a detailed user persona for someone living in that world. This foundational work will guide all your design decisions for the semester.

### Part A: World Building
Imagine a specific utopian or dystopian society.

**Deliverable:**
- Name your utopia/dystopia
- List 3-5 key aspects that make it utopian or dystopian
- Describe the environmental, social, and technological context
- Brief description (1-2 paragraphs) of how daily life differs from our present

### Part B: User Persona
Create a detailed persona for a citizen living in your imagined world.

**Deliverable:**
- Demographics (age, occupation, living situation)
- Goals and frustrations specific to their world
- Daily routines and touchpoints with technology
- 2-3 key characteristics that will inform your object design
- Visual representation (sketch, mood board, or photo collage)

### Part C: Cultural Probe (Optional enhancement)
For students who want to deepen their research, create a fictional artifact using one design research methodology:
- Diary entry from your persona
- Observational notes
- Photo study
- Interview transcript
- Shadowing log

**Tips:**
- Keep it specific but focused. Quality over quantity.
- Think about what problems exist in this world that your electronic object might address.
- Consider both the benefits and challenges of living in this society.

## 6. Concept Sell Sheet
**Due:** Week 6 (Mar 9)
**Weight:** Part of presentation grade

Create a one-page visual "sell sheet" that presents your object concept as if you were pitching it to stakeholders in your imagined future. This helps you clarify your concept and practice professional presentation skills.

**Deliverable:**
- Single-page document (digital or physical)

## 7. User Journey Map
**Due:** Week 7 (Mar 23)
**Weight:** 10% (combined with Persona)

Map out a typical day or key scenario in your user persona's life, showing touchpoints where your electronic object would be used. This helps you understand context and identify design opportunities within your speculative world.

**Deliverable:**
- Visual timeline or journey map
- 5-8 key moments/touchpoints
- Indication of where your object fits in
- Emotions/pain points noted
- Environmental and social context from your utopia/dystopia

**Format:** Can be hand-drawn, digital diagram, or simple timeline with annotations

**Note:** This assignment finalizes your Persona work. Submit both the refined persona and the journey map together.
