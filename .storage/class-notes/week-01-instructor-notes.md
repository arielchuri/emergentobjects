## Learning Student Names Strategy

### As Intro Posts Come In:
1. **Make a name sheet** with student photos from intro posts
2. **Note their improv prompt choice** — creates memorable associations
3. **Create flashcards** (physical or digital):
   - Front: Student photo
   - Back: Name, pronouns, one memorable detail from their intro
4. **Look for patterns:**
   - Who chose "Future Self" vs "Object as Origin Story"?
   - Common interests or backgrounds
   - Creative/funny details that stand out

### Review Before Week 2:
- [ ] Go through all intro posts
- [ ] Create name/photo sheet
- [ ] Review flashcards
- [ ] Note any questions or comments to bring up in class
