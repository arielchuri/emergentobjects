## CLASS TIMELINE (160 minutes total)

### 12:10-12:15 | Setup & Early Arrivals (5 min)
- Arrive 10 min early to set up
- Greet students as they arrive
- Make mental connections: face → name → intro post detail

### 12:15-12:25 | Welcome & Roll Call (10 min)
**Take attendance** (mark late arrivals after this point)

**Roll call strategy:**
- Call each name and ask for pronunciation
- Make eye contact
- Reference something from their intro post to help remember
  - *"Sam, right? The future repair cafe coordinator!"*
  - *"Jordan, you're the one who collects calculators — or was that the fabrication?"*

**Brief welcome:**
- Course overview (1-2 minutes)
- Acknowledge asynchronous work completed
- Preview today's agenda

---

### 12:25-12:45 | In-Person Introductions & Icebreaker (20 min)

**Quick round of live intros** (even though they posted):
- Name, pronouns
- One word to describe their week of async work ("overwhelming," "exciting," "confusing," etc.)
- This helps YOU hear names again and make more connections

**Optional name game** (if time permits):
- Students say their name + an object that starts with the same letter
- Example: "I'm Ariel and I like... Arduino"
- Helps you remember AND loosens everyone up

---

### 12:45-1:10 | Community Agreements Discussion (25 min)

**Collaborative agreement building:**

1. **Review key statements** (5 min):
   - Curricular Justice Acknowledgment
   - Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Statement
   - Pronouns Statement

2. **Small group brainstorm** (10 min):
   - Break into groups of 3-4
   - "What do we need from each other to learn well?"
   - Write ideas on post-its or shared doc

3. **Share out & finalize** (10 min):
   - Each group shares 2-3 agreements
   - Create master list on board
   - Ensure coverage of:
     - Respect and active listening
     - Risk-taking and experimentation
     - Communication and attendance
     - Critique culture
     - Collaboration expectations

**Document final agreements** → add to Canvas

---

### 1:10-1:30 | Lecture: The User Persona (20 min)

**Key concepts to cover:**
- What is a persona and why use them?
- Difference between persona and stereotype
- How personas inform design decisions
- Connection to their Utopia/Dystopia worlds

**Show examples:**
- 2-3 sample personas (simple → detailed)
- Point out: demographics, goals, frustrations, context
- Emphasize: specificity creates better design

**Link to their work:**
- Their personas live in THEIR speculative worlds
- The world shapes the person shapes the needs shapes the object

**Resources/slides:** [Prepare persona lecture slides]

---

### 1:30-1:40 | BREAK (10 min)

**During break:**
- Review intro posts again on laptop
- Quiz yourself on names
- Check in with any quiet students

---

### 1:40-2:15 | Demo: Basic Python (35 min)

**Cover:**
1. **Python basics** (15 min):
   - Variables (strings, integers, floats)
   - Print statements
   - Input from user
   - Basic data types

2. **Conditionals** (15 min):
   - If/else statements
   - Comparison operators
   - Simple logic

3. **Live coding example** (5 min):
   - Build a simple program together
   - Temperature converter or simple quiz
   - Show commenting code

**Tips:**
- Type slowly and explain each line
- Ask students to predict output before running
- Welcome questions
- Emphasize: coding is iterative, errors are normal

**Example code to demo:**
```python
# Simple user input and conditional
name = input("What's your name? ")
year = int(input("What year are you? "))

print(f"Hi {name}!")

if year == 1:
    print("Welcome to your first year!")
elif year == 2:
    print("You're halfway through!")
else:
    print("Keep going!")
```

### 2:15-2:45 | Workshop: Logic Puzzles (30 min)

**Activity:**
- Hand out logic puzzle worksheets
- Students work individually or in pairs
- Puzzles focus on conditional thinking and problem-solving
- Walk around, check in, help where needed

**Debrief** (last 5-10 min):
- How did you approach the problems?
- What strategies worked?
- How is this like programming?

**Connect to Python assignment:**
- Logic puzzles = same thinking as if/else
- Breaking problems into steps
- Testing solutions

---

### 2:45-2:50 | Wrap-Up & Assignments (5 min)

**Quick review:**
- What's due next week? **Python App (Week 3, Feb 9)**
- Remind about office hours
- Answer quick questions

**Preview Week 3:**
- Electricity fundamentals
- Circuit prototyping
- Hands-on with components

**Final reminder:**
- Check Canvas for updates
- Start Python assignment early
- Reach out if stuck!

## ATTENDANCE & NAME LEARNING

### Attendance Sheet Template:

| Photo | Name | Pronouns | Intro Detail | Present? | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|--------------|----------|-------|
| [img] | Sam Jones | they/them | Future repair cafe | ✓ | Asked good Python question |
| [img] | Alex Kim | she/her | Collects calculators (?) | ✓ | Quiet, check in next week |
| [img] | Jordan Lee | he/him | From Portland | Late 5min | |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

### Name Learning Tips:
1. **Use names frequently during class**
   - "Great question, Sam!"
   - "What do you think, Alex?"

2. **Connect face + name + detail:**

   - Many will sit in same spot next week

4. **Post-class review:**
   - After class, go through faces and practice recalling names
   - Note students you're still struggling with

5. **Use intro posts:**
   - Keep them open during class
   - Quick reference for details to mention
