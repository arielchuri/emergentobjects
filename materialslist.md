## Microcontroller
- [Adafruit Circuit Playground Express](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-circuit-playground-express/overview) $24.95
- [Arduino](https://store-usa.arduino.cc/products/arduino-uno-rev3?selectedStore=us)
- [Raspberry Pi Pico](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5525)

Adafruit has these back in stock and I have some as well that I can bring to class if you ask.

### Examples of premade kits

- [Discover Electronics Kit](http://sparklelabs.com/index_store.php) $46.75 - I make these.
- [Make Electronics Kit](https://www.amazon.com/Make-Electronics-Intermediate-Component-Experiments/dp/B09HL84X33/) $117.99 - Includes a Multitester and soldering iron.

These two are the most barebones I could find on amazon. The quality maybe low but they should be good enough.
- [amazon Kit 1](https://smile.amazon.com/REXQualis-Electronics-tie-Points-Breadboard-Potentiometer/dp/B073ZC68QG/) $18.49
- [Amazon Kit 2](https://smile.amazon.com/EL-CK-002-Electronic-Breadboard-Capacitor-Potentiometer/dp/B01ERP6WL4/) $13.99

## Multimeter
All of these are low quality but will work fine for our purposes.
- I have a low end model and can bring it to class. $9.00
- [One of many on amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/AstroAI-Digital-Multimeter-Voltage-Tester/dp/B01ISAMUA6/) $12.50
- [Adafruit Multimeter](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2034) $17.50
