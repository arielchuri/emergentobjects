# Lecture: Utopia/Dystopia

**Week:** 1 (Asynchronous)
**Duration:** ~45 minutes

## Learning Outcomes

This lecture supports the following learning outcomes:

- **LO 1 - Critical Thinking:** Critically reflect on how the design and function of an electronic object challenge societal values or ecological sustainability.
- **LO 5 - Broad Application:** Use speculative scenarios to inspire creative problem-solving across art, design, and strategic thinking fields.
- **LO 6 - Life:** Reflect on personal responsibility and self-understanding through the creation of objects that respond to a utopian or dystopian future.

## Overview

This lecture introduces students to the concepts of utopian and dystopian futures as frameworks for speculative design. Students will explore how designers, artists, and writers imagine alternative futures and use these visions to critique present-day society and technology.

## Key Topics

### What is Utopia?
- Historical origins and definitions
- Characteristics of utopian visions
- Examples in literature, film, and design
- Relationship to social and technological optimism
- Critiques and limitations of utopian thinking

### What is Dystopia?
- Definitions and characteristics
- Common dystopian themes (surveillance, control, environmental collapse, etc.)
- Examples across media
- Why dystopia dominates contemporary imagination
- Value of dystopian thinking as social critique

### Speculative Design
- Using design to imagine alternative futures
- Design fiction and critical design
- Objects as storytelling devices
- How speculation can inform present-day decisions
- The role of designers in shaping futures

### Technology and Society
- How technology shapes social structures
- Unintended consequences of innovation
- Who benefits from technological change?
- Ethical responsibilities of designers
- Case studies of objects that changed society

### Objects as Cultural Artifacts
- How objects reflect values and beliefs
- The politics of everyday things
- What our objects say about us
- Imagining objects from other futures

## Examples to Discuss

### Utopian
- Star Trek's replicator and post-scarcity society
- Solar punk aesthetic and sustainable futures
- Universal design and accessibility
- Collaborative tools and open source culture
- Community-focused technologies

### Dystopian
- Black Mirror episodes and technological anxiety
- Surveillance capitalism and data extraction
- E-waste and planned obsolescence
- Algorithmic bias and automation
- Climate change impacts

### Speculative Design Projects
- Dunne & Raby's work
- Near Future Laboratory
- Superflux
- Design fiction examples
- Student work from previous semesters

## Key Questions for Discussion

- What assumptions about the future do our current technologies embed?
- Who gets to imagine and build the future?
- What responsibilities do designers have when creating new technologies?
- How can we use speculation productively rather than just as dystopian anxiety?
- What kind of future do you want to help create?

## Activities

- **Visual Analysis:** Examine images from utopian and dystopian visions
- **Object Study:** Analyze everyday objects for embedded values
- **Scenario Brainstorm:** Generate possible future scenarios
- **Reading Discussion:** Discuss assigned readings on speculation and design

## Connections to Course

This lecture sets the conceptual foundation for the entire semester:
- Students will choose a utopian or dystopian scenario for their final project
- The Utopia/Dystopia LP Post assignment builds directly from this lecture
- This framework informs all subsequent design decisions
- Encourages critical thinking about technology throughout the course

## Resources

### Readings
- "Design Noir" by Anthony Dunne & Fiona Raby
- "Speculative Everything" excerpts
- "The Future Mundane" by Nick Foster
- Selected science fiction short stories

### Videos
- TED Talks on speculative design
- Film clips from key utopian/dystopian films
- Design project walkthroughs

### Websites
- Examples of speculative design projects
- Solar punk and hopepunk resources
- Black Mirror episode guides
- Design museum collections

## Assessment

Students demonstrate understanding through:
- Utopia/Dystopia Learning Portfolio Post (due Week 2)
- Class participation in scenario discussions
- Integration into final project concept

## Tips for Teaching

- Start with familiar examples (films, TV shows) students know
- Balance dystopian and utopian examples - don't get too dark
- Encourage genuine speculation, not just sci-fi tropes
- Connect to current events and technologies
- Make space for diverse cultural perspectives on futures
- Help students see this isn't just creative - it's critical thinking
- Emphasize that they're not predicting the future, but using futures thinking
