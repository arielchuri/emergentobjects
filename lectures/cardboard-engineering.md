# Lecture: Cardboard Engineering

**Week:** 7
**Date:** Mar 23
**Duration:** ~45 minutes

## Learning Outcomes

This lecture supports the following learning outcomes:

- **LO 2 - Tools, Materials, Methods:** Write and debug basic Python code and create electronic circuits using microprocessors.
- **LO 3 - Experimentation:** Play with the concept of a "fantastic object" and experiment with non-traditional human-object interactions through play and discovery.

## Overview

This lecture introduces rapid prototyping and enclosure building techniques using accessible materials, primarily cardboard and common craft supplies. Students learn how to translate 2D designs into 3D forms, create housings for electronics, and build functional, aesthetic enclosures for their projects.

## Key Topics

### Why Cardboard?

#### Advantages
- Inexpensive and readily available
- Easy to cut and shape
- Forgiving for beginners
- Rapid iteration possible
- Structurally capable when used correctly
- Can be finished to look professional
- Environmentally friendly
- Widely used in professional prototyping

#### Design Philosophy
- Form follows function
- Prototype early and often
- Fail fast, learn quickly
- Low-stakes experimentation
- Bridge between concept and final form

### Cardboard as an Engineering Material

#### Types of Cardboard
- **Corrugated:** Strong, lightweight, structural
- **Chipboard:** Smooth, good for panels and facings
- **Mat board:** Clean edges, professional appearance
- **Foam core:** Smooth surface, lightweight
- **Museum board:** High-quality, archival

#### Structural Principles
- Grain direction and strength
- Corrugation orientation
- Layering for thickness and rigidity
- Folding vs cutting
- Internal structure and bracing
- Stress points and reinforcement

### Design and Planning

#### From Sketch to 3D
- Orthographic projections (top, front, side views)
- Net patterns (unfolded 3D forms)
- Measuring and planning for components
- Accounting for material thickness
- Designing for assembly
- Access panels and openings

#### Enclosure Requirements
- Must house all electronics safely
- Provide access to inputs (buttons, sensors)
- Allow outputs (LEDs, screens, speakers) to function
- Can be opened for maintenance/changes
- Protects components from damage
- Supports user interaction
- Expresses design intent

### Tools and Techniques

#### Essential Tools
- **Cutting:** X-Acto knife, box cutter, scissors
- **Measuring:** Ruler, T-square, measuring tape
- **Marking:** Pencil, marker, awl for scoring
- **Assembly:** Hot glue, white glue, tape, brads
- **Shaping:** Sandpaper, files
- **Protection:** Cutting mat, safety equipment

#### Cutting Techniques
- Multiple light passes vs single heavy cut
- Using a straightedge for clean lines
- Cutting vs scoring for folds
- Curved cuts and circles
- Making holes for components
- Safety: Always cut away from yourself

#### Joining Techniques
- **Tab and slot:** Interlocking pieces
- **Butt joints:** Edge-to-edge
- **Lap joints:** Overlapping for strength
- **Corner joints:** 90-degree connections
- Glue types and applications
- Temporary vs permanent assembly

### Construction Methods

#### Box Construction
- Simple rectangular boxes
- Custom-fit enclosures
- Hinged lids
- Sliding panels
- Modular sections

#### Curved Forms
- Score lines for smooth curves
- Triangulation for compound curves
- Strip construction
- Lamination techniques
- Organic shapes

#### Openings and Access
- Button holes (precise sizing)
- LED windows
- Sensor apertures
- USB port access
- Removable panels
- Hinged doors

### Finishing Techniques

#### Surface Preparation
- Sanding edges smooth
- Filling gaps and imperfections
- Sealing cardboard surface
- Creating smooth facade

#### Painting and Coating
- Primer/gesso for better paint adhesion
- Acrylic paints
- Spray paint techniques
- Clear coats for protection
- Texture effects

#### Decorative Options
- Covering with fabric or paper
- Vinyl wrap
- Stickers and decals
- Laser-cut overlays
- Found materials and mixed media

### Integration with Electronics

#### Planning for Components
- Measure twice, cut once
- Leave clearance for wires
- Consider heat from components
- Weight distribution
- Battery access
- Switch and button mounting

#### Mounting Electronics
- Hot glue for temporary/semi-permanent
- Velcro for removable components
- Standoffs and spacers
- Wire management inside enclosure
- Strain relief for connections
- Accessing USB port for programming

### From Prototype to Final

#### Iterative Process
1. Paper mockup (quick, no commitment)
2. Cardboard prototype v1 (test fit)
3. Cardboard prototype v2 (refined)
4. Final cardboard (polished) OR
5. Transition to other materials

#### When to Move Beyond Cardboard
- Project requires durability
- Water/weather exposure
- Higher aesthetic requirements
- Available tools and skills
- Time and budget constraints

### Alternative Materials

#### Other Rapid Prototyping Materials
- Foam board and foam sheets
- Wood (balsa, plywood, MDF)
- Acrylic (laser cut or hand-worked)
- 3D printing
- Found objects and repurposing
- Mixed materials approach

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Simple Box Enclosure
- Rectangular form
- Top access panel
- Button mounted in front face
- LED window
- Open bottom for electronics access

### Example 2: Sculptural Form
- Organic, non-rectilinear shape
- Multiple pieces assembled
- Integrated with object concept
- Shows personality and character

### Example 3: Handheld Device
- Ergonomic considerations
- Button placement for thumb access
- Weight and balance
- Comfortable to hold

## Key Questions

- How do you account for material thickness in your design?
- What's the best way to make clean, straight cuts?
- How do you create curved surfaces from flat material?
- Where do you need strength vs. where can you save material?
- How will users physically interact with the object?
- How do you balance aesthetic goals with functional requirements?

## Demonstrations

### Live Demonstrations
1. **Net to box:** Folding a flat pattern into 3D form
2. **Precise cutting:** Straight lines and curves
3. **Hole making:** For buttons and components
4. **Assembly:** Different joining techniques
