## Learning Outcomes

This lecture supports the following learning outcomes:

- **LO 4 - Discipline Specific:** Apply design research methodologies and analyze user behaviors to develop detailed personas and user journeys.

## Overview

This lecture introduces students to user personas as a design research tool. Students learn how to develop rich, research-based character profiles that represent target users and guide design decisions throughout the creative process.

## Key Topics

### What is a Persona?
- Definition and purpose in design process
- Difference between personas and stereotypes
- When and why to use personas
- Limitations and critiques of persona methodology
- Evolution of persona practice

### Components of a Persona
- Demographic information (age, occupation, location)
- Background and context
- Goals and motivations
- Frustrations and pain points
- Behaviors and habits
- Technology comfort and usage
- Values and beliefs
- Relationship to your speculative scenario

### Research-Based Design
- Observational research methods
- Interview techniques
- Finding patterns in user behavior
- Balancing specificity with representativeness
- Avoiding bias and assumptions
- Empathy in design practice

### Creating Effective Personas
- How much detail is enough?
- Making personas believable and memorable
- Using personas throughout design process
- Updating personas based on learning
- Multiple personas vs. primary persona

### Personas in Speculative Context
- Adapting personas for imagined futures
- Extrapolating from present behaviors
- Considering how scenarios shape users
- Maintaining believability in speculation
- Using personas to explore alternative values

## Examples

### Strong Persona Examples
- Share 3-4 well-developed personas from various contexts
- Discuss what makes each effective
- Show how they informed design decisions
- Include both traditional and speculative examples

### Weak Persona Examples
- Show stereotypical or shallow personas
- Discuss what's missing
- Analyze how these fail to guide design
- Learn from common mistakes

### Student Work
- Previous semester persona examples
- Range of approaches and styles
- How personas evolved into projects

## Key Questions

- How do you avoid creating stereotypes?
- What research methods help you understand users?
- How specific should a persona be?
- What do you do when your persona doesn't match your assumptions?
- How does a persona for a speculative future differ from traditional UX personas?

## Activities

### In-Class Exercise
- **Persona Speed Sketch:** Quick 10-minute persona development
- **Peer Review:** Share and critique personas in pairs
- **Scenario Mapping:** Connect personas to speculative scenarios

### Homework Preview
- Review Persona LP Post assignment requirements
- Discuss research approaches
- Timeline and checkpoints

## Process Guidance

### Steps for Creating Your Persona
1. **Research phase:** Observe, interview, read
2. **Pattern finding:** Look for commonalities and insights
3. **Drafting:** Write initial persona description
4. **Visual development:** Find/create images
5. **Refinement:** Add detail and specificity
6. **Validation:** Does this feel real and useful?

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Generic demographics without depth
- Stereotypes and clichés
- No connection to research or observation
- Too many personas (analysis paralysis)
- Personas that don't guide decisions
- Forgetting the speculative context

## Connections to Course

- Persona assignment due Week 4
- Persona informs all subsequent design work
- Connects to User Journey (Week 7)

- Referenced in final presentation

## Resources

### Readings
- "The Inmates Are Running the Asylum" by Alan Cooper
- "Designing for the Digital Age" by Kim Goodwin (persona chapters)
- Critiques of persona methodology
- Speculative design and character development

### Tools
- Persona templates and frameworks
- Research interview guides
- Observation frameworks
- Digital tools for persona creation

### Examples
- UX persona archives and collections
- Speculative design persona examples
- personas directory in course repository

## Assessment

Students demonstrate understanding through:
- Persona LP Post (due Week 4 - Feb 23)
- Quality of research and depth of character
- Integration into project development
- Use of persona in design decisions

## Tips for Teaching

- Start with familiar products/services and their target users
- Share your own persona development process
- Emphasize research over imagination alone
- Show both successes and failures
- Make it clear personas are tools, not products
- Connect personas to empathy and human-centered design
- Discuss ethical considerations in representation
- Help students balance specificity with projection
- Encourage diversity in persona development
- Link back to utopian/dystopian scenarios from Week 1
