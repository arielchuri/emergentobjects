# Lecture: Product Photography

**Week:** 12
**Date:** Apr 27
**Duration:** ~45 minutes

## Learning Outcomes

This lecture supports the following learning outcomes:

- **LO 7 - Reflection:** Document their process and reflect on their learning via the Parsons Learning Portfolio.

## Overview

This lecture teaches students how to professionally photograph their completed projects for documentation, portfolio presentation, and communication of their design work. Good photography is essential for showcasing the quality and concept of their emergent objects.

## Key Topics

### Why Documentation Matters

#### Purpose of Project Photography
- Portfolio development for future opportunities
- Learning Portfolio requirement
- Communicating your work to others
- Professional presentation skills
- Archiving your creative work
- Social media and online sharing
- Grant and job applications

#### What Makes Good Product Photography?
- Shows the object clearly
- Captures design details
- Demonstrates scale
- Conveys the concept
- Professional quality
- Consistent lighting
- Clean, uncluttered composition
- Tells a story

### Photography Fundamentals

#### The Exposure Triangle

**Aperture (f-stop)**
- Controls depth of field
- f/8-f/11 good for product shots (more in focus)
- f/2.8-f/4 for selective focus
- Larger number = more in focus

**Shutter Speed**
- Controls motion blur
- Use tripod for slower speeds
- 1/60s minimum for handheld
- Faster for demonstration shots

**ISO**
- Sensor sensitivity
- Lower is better (less noise)
- ISO 100-400 ideal for product photography
- Increase only if needed for exposure

#### Focus and Sharpness
- Focus on key features
- Use manual focus for precision
- Focus stacking for maximum sharpness
- Check focus by zooming in on screen

### Lighting for Product Photography

#### Natural Light
- Soft, diffused window light ideal
- Shoot near large window
- Avoid direct sunlight (too harsh)
- Overcast days provide even light
- Time of day matters
- Free and accessible

#### Artificial Light
- Continuous LED lights
- Photography lights/softboxes
- Desk lamps (budget option)
- White balance considerations
- Avoiding color casts
- Multiple light sources

#### Lighting Setups

**Key Light**
- Primary light source
- Positioned 45° to side and above
- Provides main illumination

**Fill Light**
- Reduces shadows
- Opposite side from key light
- Lower intensity than key
- Can use reflector instead

**Back/Rim Light**
- Separates object from background
- Adds depth
- Optional but effective

**Three-Point Lighting**
- Classic setup using all three
- Professional, dimensional results
- Adaptable to different objects

### Backgrounds and Environments

#### Clean Backgrounds
- White, black, or neutral colors
- Seamless paper or fabric
- Plain walls
- Removes distractions
- Focus on object

#### Contextual Shots
- Show object in use
- Include hands for scale
- Environment that supports concept
- Tells story of interaction
- Links to persona/scenario

#### DIY Solutions
- Large sheets of paper
- Fabric backdrops
- Foam core boards
- Light tents for small objects
- Photographer's tape

### Composition

#### Rule of Thirds
- Divide frame into 3x3 grid
- Place subject at intersections
- Creates dynamic composition
- More interesting than centering

#### Angles and Perspectives
- **Eye level:** Natural, relatable
- **High angle:** Shows top surface
- **Low angle:** Makes object feel important
- **45° angle:** Shows multiple faces
- **Macro/detail:** Highlights craftsmanship

#### Multiple Shots Needed
1. **Hero shot:** Best overall view
2. **Detail shots:** Close-ups of features
3. **Scale shot:** Object with size reference
4. **In-use shot:** Hands interacting
5. **Technical shot:** Shows internals or back
6. **Context shot:** Object in environment

### Camera Settings

#### For Product Photography
- Manual mode for consistency
- RAW format if possible (more editing flexibility)
- Lower ISO (100-400)
- Appropriate aperture (f/8-f/11)
- Use tripod
- Timer or remote to avoid shake
- White balance set correctly

#### Using Phone Cameras
- Modern phones are capable
- Clean the lens!
- Use gridlines
- Tap to focus
- Expose for highlights
- Portrait mode for selective focus
- Edit in good apps (Snapseed, Lightroom mobile)

### Demonstrating Functionality

#### Showing Interaction
- Include hands or human element
- Multiple frames showing sequence
- Capture LED lights on/off
- Show movement or change
- Video as supplement

#### Technical Challenges
- Photographing LEDs (tricky exposures)
- Showing screens clearly
- Capturing movement
- Low-light situations
- Reflective surfaces

### Post-Processing

#### Basic Adjustments
- Crop and straighten
- Exposure correction
- White balance adjustment
- Contrast and clarity
- Remove distractions (spot healing)
- Sharpening

#### Software Options
- Free: GIMP, Photoshop Express, Snapseed
- Paid: Adobe Lightroom, Photoshop
- Phone apps: VSCO, Snapseed, Lightroom Mobile
- Batch processing for consistency

#### What NOT to Do
- Over-saturating colors
- Excessive filters
- Hiding poor craft with editing
- Misrepresenting the actual object
- Over-sharpening

### Documentation Requirements for Course

#### Minimum Required Shots
1. Clean hero shot on neutral background
2. 3-4 detail shots showing features
3. Scale reference shot
4. In-use/interaction shot
5. Shot showing electronics (if relevant)

#### File Requirements
- High resolution (at least 2000px on long side)
- Well-exposed and in focus
- Clean backgrounds
- Properly edited
- Named appropriately

### Creating a Photo Portfolio

#### Organization
- Select best shots only
- Show variety of angles
- Include process shots
- Arrange in logical sequence
- Consider narrative flow

#### Presentation
- Consistent style across images
- Similar crops and ratios
- Matching color/tone
- Professional appearance
- Clear, readable when viewed online

## Practical Demonstrations

### Live Setup
1. **Basic setup:** Show complete lighting arrangement
2. **Multiple angles:** Same object, different perspectives
3. **Before/after editing:** Show improvement from post-processing
4. **Common mistakes:** Identify and fix issues
5. **Phone photography:** Show phone can produce good results

### Setup Examples
- Simple window light setup
- DIY light tent
