**FIRST YEAR RECOMMENDED POLICIES**   
**FOR ATTENDANCE AND PARTICIPATION** 

*The following suggested policies are designed only taking into consideration the structure of courses based on meeting time, and type of course (seminar/studio). We acknowledge that not every seminar course or every studio course is the same and there are specific considerations that must be taken into account when creating an attendance and participation policy. Please use this language as a base to craft your own.* 

* *If you wish to explore other templates for crafting an attendance and participation policy, you can view templates [**here**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S-ZCmWg9q1zDfdFZ4jBE0TnIS-dnteC1oWiDk4hhjwg/edit?tab=t.0).*   
* *If you wish to write your own attendance and participation policy, you can consult [**this policy flowchart**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xFvtwrq1CwpHzc3VQsOt8JIQ6y_dgDwWldZHX1P_Abs/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.8hbde7w4jlpy) which links to suggestions and templates based on your answers.*  
* *If you wish to review the full guidelines and recommendations for attendance and participation as defined by First Year faculty, you can review the [**FY Guidelines document here**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17LWERg7jOR-gGJIJIONhKdQkrOSDk2bGeI0qFIBQa2s/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.4ve3y5ymb75b)**.*** 

**SEMINAR COURSES**   
(Integrative Seminar & Objects as History)

Your final grade will be calculated based on attendance (10%), meaningful class participation (30%) and projects (60% total). 

**Attendance:** An absence is an absence (there is no difference between excused or unexcused). Your attendance grade (10%) will be affected after 2 absences. Each absence after that will take 2% off your attendance grade. 3 late arrivals or early departures will equal 1 absence. **Being absent 5 times will result in losing all the attendance part of your grade, which will make it not possible to have an A**. Students who must miss a class session should notify the instructor (ideally in an email prior to the class meeting) and make up any missed work as soon as possible. The student is responsible for following the course on Canvas and continuing to meet due dates, regardless of absences. A student who anticipates an extended period of absence should immediately inform the faculty and his or her program advisor.

**Participation:** The following 30% grade calculation demonstrates the need for your consistent participation, and equally as important, your active engagement in each step of the learning process. Class participation involves staying up to date with readings and assignments and contributing meaningfully to discussions and group work. This class aims to create a safe space for discussion and collective knowledge-building. Respectful communication is essential: students should listen actively, engage thoughtfully, and avoid interrupting or dismissing others. Diverse perspectives are valued, and all are encouraged to share their experiences and ideas to foster a collaborative and inclusive learning environment. As a result, meaningful participation also requires refraining from using laptops or cellphones, except for in-class assignments and note-taking. **Lack of weekly participation will also have an impact on your grade, which can result in subtracting up to 10% for lack of participation in class discussions or failure to present projects for peer reviews or feedback sessions, 10% for missing in-class exercises and activities, and 10% for failing to use the Learning Portfolio as a tool for reflection.** If you lose the whole 30% of your participation grade, the highest grade you will be able to achieve would be a C, given you get the maximum grades in your projects and have good attendance. 

**Students who do not come to class regularly, keep fluid communication with faculty, or participate meaningfully in class week-to-week won’t be able to get an A grade, regardless of how high they score in their projects.** 

**15 SESSION STUDIO COURSES**  
(Integrative Studio 1 & 2, Sustainable Systems)

Your final grade will be calculated based on attendance (10%) and meaningful class participation (30%) and projects (60% total). 

**Attendance:** An absence is an absence (there is no difference between excused or unexcused). Your attendance grade (10%) will be affected after 2 absences. Each absence after that will take 2% off your attendance grade. 3 late arrivals or early departures will equal 1 absence. **Being absent 5 times will result in losing all the attendance part of your grade, which will make it not possible to have an A**.

A student who anticipates an extended period of absence should immediately inform the faculty and his or her program advisor.

**Participation:** The following 30% grade calculation demonstrates the need for your consistent participation, and equally as important, your active engagement in each step of the learning process.   
Weekly participation will allow you to successfully complete course projects, get important process feedback and to contribute to our learning community. This is even more important given the making based nature of this course. Missing even one class can cause a significant setback in your ability to meet project/assignment deadlines. **Lack of weekly participation will also have an impact on your grade, which can result in subtracting up to 10% for lack of participation in class discussions or failure to present projects for peer reviews or feedback sessions, 10% for missing in-class exercises and activities, and 10% for failing to use the Learning Portfolio as a tool for reflection**. If you lose the whole 30% of your participation grade, the highest grade you will be able to achieve would be a C, given you get the maximum grades in your projects and have good attendance. 

**Students who do not come to class regularly, keep fluid communication with faculty, or participate meaningfully in class week-to-week won’t be able to get an A grade, regardless of how high they score in their projects.** 

**30 SESSIONS STUDIO COURSES**   
(Time, Drawing Imaging & Space Materiality)

Your final grade will be calculated based on attendance (10%), meaningful class participation (30%) and projects (60% total). 

**Attendance:** An absence is an absence (there is no difference between excused or unexcused). Your attendance grade (10%) will be affected after 2 absences. Each absence after that will take 1.25% off your attendance grade. 2 late arrivals or early departures will equal 1 absence. **Being absent 10 times will result in losing all the attendance part of your grade, which will make it not possible to have an A**. Students who must miss a class session should notify the instructor (ideally in an email prior to the class meeting) and make up any missed work as soon as possible. The student is responsible for following the course on Canvas and continuing to meet due dates, regardless of absences. A student who anticipates an extended period of absence should immediately inform the faculty and his or her program advisor.
