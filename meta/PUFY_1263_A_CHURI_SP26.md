## Learning Portfolio

You will use the Parsons Learning Portfolio throughout your education at Parsons. It is an ongoing, cumulative repository for your creative development and experience across courses, and across years. It archives your working process, skills learned, and connections you make between assignments, courses, and years, as well as final "finished" work. The courses in the first year emphasize the process – how you started, what happened next (and why), and how you ended up at your final work for each project.

Showing preliminary work (sketches, drafts, notes, research, etc.) as well as final documentation of your work will help to tell your story and make connections that may not have otherwise been apparent. In Integrative Seminar and Studio, the Parsons Learning Portfolio will serve as a bridging mechanism to aid conversation and provide access to projects and writings across the seminar and studio, and stimulate critically reflective learning, thinking, writing and making.

Make sure to use the MANDATORY Parsons Learning Portfolio Template- and do not change the template as this is a shared component of the Parsons experience. Also please add a Learning Portfolio link to your Canvas Bio. This allows fellow students and faculty to access your portfolio. **Your work for this class on the Learning Portfolio accounts for 10% of your grade**.

## Learning Together/Community Agreement

At the beginning of the semester students and faculty will work together to establish a common culture/approach for learning together that could take the form of Community Agreements. As you prepare for this process is important for you to review the following statements:

- [**CURRICULAR JUSTICE ACKNOWLEDGMENT STATEMENT**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14V-8ZIv2iLAY23y2WNBeHAHvZhaUU00bsG9txSAhl4Y/edit?usp=sharing)
- [**STATEMENT ON DIVERSITY, EQUITY & INCLUSION**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kuMJ6carMfWwjPEiSnm7FUKNn2U0hOwG3T6r0ZNMpac/edit?usp=sharing)
- [**PRONOUNS STATEMENT**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G2MvyMR9jLRjMuM_FDHVZp6LIpWn_ycGzny9UZyRYoc/edit?usp=sharing)

**This course Community Agreements and Guidelines to Learning Together are:**

We will establish these agreements together on the first day of class. Some principles to guide our work together include:

- Respect for all voices and perspectives in the classroom
- Active listening during critiques and discussions
- Taking creative risks and supporting others as they experiment
- Being present and engaged during class time
- Clear communication about challenges or absences
- Collaborative problem-solving and mutual support

---

## Grading and Evaluation

Students' ability to meet the course's learning outcomes will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

- Attend regularly and communicate any challenge or absences to their faculty
- Solve problems, both creative and technical through an iterative process
- Turn in project assignments and course material on time
- Document their research in the development of projects
- Describe the cross-course exploration between the Studio and Seminar
- Participate in class discussions and critiques
- Be accountable in collaborative work
- Improve in technical, creative, and problem solving abilities
- Submit thoughtful studio works that have undertaken several stages of ideation

---

## About Attendance and Grading

**Attendance:** Attendance will be taken at the start of every class to encourage punctuality. An absence is an absence (there is no difference between excused or unexcused). Your attendance grade (10%) will be affected after 2 absences. Each absence after that will take 2% off your attendance grade. 3 late arrivals or early departures will equal 1 absence. **Being absent 5 times will result in losing all the attendance part of your grade, which will make it not possible to have an A**. Students who must miss a class session should notify the instructor (ideally in an email prior to the class meeting) and make up any missed work as soon as possible. The student is responsible for following the course on Canvas and continuing to meet due dates, regardless of absences. A student who anticipates an extended period of absence should immediately inform the faculty and his or her program advisor.

**Participation:** The following 40% grade calculation demonstrates the need for your consistent participation, and equally as important, your active engagement in each step of the learning process.   
Weekly participation will allow you to successfully complete course projects, get important process feedback and to contribute to our learning community. This is even more important given the making based nature of this course. Missing even one class can cause a significant setback in your ability to meet project/assignment deadlines. **Lack of weekly participation will also have an impact on your grade, which can result in subtracting up to 10% for lack of participation in class discussions or failure to present projects for peer reviews or feedback sessions, 10% for missing in-class exercises and activities, and 10% for failing to use the Learning Portfolio as a tool for reflection**. If you lose the whole 30% of your participation grade, the highest grade you will be able to achieve would be a C, given you get the maximum grades in your projects and have good attendance. 

**Students who do not come to class regularly, keep fluid communication with faculty, or participate meaningfully in class week-to-week won’t be able to get an A grade, regardless of how high they score in their projects.**

## Grading Standards

### Undergraduate

A student's final grades and GPA are calculated using a 4.0 scale.

**Undergraduate**  
A student’s final grades and GPA are calculated using a 4.0 scale.

A \[4.0\] Work of exceptional quality, which often goes beyond the stated goals of the course (95-100%)
A- \[3.7\] Work of very high quality (90% \- \<95%)
B+ \[3.3\] Work of high quality that indicates higher than average abilities (87% \- \<90%)
B \[3.0\] Very good work that satisfies the goals of the course (83% \- \<87%)
B- \[2.7\] Good work (80% \- \<83%)
C+ \[2.3\] Above-average work (77% \- \<80%)
C \[2.0\] Average work that indicates an understanding of the course material; passable (73% \- \<77%);
Satisfactory completion of a course is considered to be a grade of C or higher.
C- \[1.7\] Passing work but below good academic standing (70% \- \<73%)
D \[1.0\] Below-average work that indicates a student does not fully understand the assignments (60% \- \<70%); Probation level though passing for credit
F \[0.0\] Failure, no credit (0% \- \<60%)
GM Grade missing for an individual

### Grade of W

The grade of W may be issued by the Office of the Registrar to a student who officially withdraws from a course within the applicable deadline. There is no academic penalty, but the grade will appear on the student transcript.

### Grades of Incomplete

The grade of I, or temporary incomplete, may be granted to a student under unusual and extenuating circumstances, such as when the student's academic life is interrupted by a medical or personal emergency. This mark is not given automatically but only upon the student's request and at the discretion of the instructor. A Request for Incomplete form must be completed and signed by the student, instructor and program director. The time allowed for completion of the work and removal of the "I" mark will be set by the instructor with the following limitations:

**Undergraduate students:** Work must be completed no later than the seventh week of the following fall semester for spring or summer term incompletes and no later than the seventh week of the following spring semester for fall term incompletes. Grades of "I" not revised in the prescribed time will be recorded as a final grade of "F" by the Registrar's Office.

## College, School, Program and Class Policies

A comprehensive overview of policy may be found under [Policies: A to Z](https://www.newschool.edu/student-conduct/policies/). Students are also encouraged to consult the [Academic Catalog for Parsons](https://www.newschool.edu/parsons/academic-catalog/).

### Canvas

Use of Canvas may be an important resource for this class. Students should check it for announcements before coming to class each week.

### Electronic Devices

The use of electronic devices (phones, tablets, laptops, cameras, etc.) is permitted when the device is being used in relation to the course's work. All other uses are prohibited in the classroom and devices should be turned off before class starts.

### Responsibility

Students are responsible for all assignments, even if they are absent. Late assignments, failure to complete the assignments for class discussion and/or critique, and lack of preparedness for in-class discussions, presentations and/or critiques will jeopardize your successful completion of this course.

### Active Participation and Attendance

Class participation is an essential part of class and includes: keeping up with reading, assignments, projects, contributing meaningfully to class discussions, active participation in group work, and attending synchronous sessions regularly and on time.

Parsons' attendance guidelines were developed to encourage students' success in all aspects of their academic programs. Full participation is essential to the successful completion of coursework and enhances the quality of the educational experience for all, particularly in courses where group work is integral; thus, Parsons promotes high levels of attendance. Students are expected to attend classes regularly and promptly and in compliance with the standards stated in this course syllabus.

While attendance is just one aspect of active participation, absence from a significant portion of class time may prevent the successful attainment of course objectives. A significant portion of class time is generally defined as the equivalent of three weeks, or 20%, of class time. Lateness or early departure from class may be recorded as one full absence. Students may be asked to withdraw from a course if habitual absenteeism or tardiness has a negative impact on the class environment.

I will assess each student's performance against all of the assessment criteria in determining your final grade.

## Using AI and Generative Tools in Parsons First Year

Please note that the use of Artificial Intelligence and generative text and image tools are addressed in [the New School statement on Student Academic Integrity](https://www.newschool.edu/student-conduct/academic-integrity/). As a general rule please consider the following with regards to AI:

- Do not submit any final work - writing or images - generated by AI tools without written permission from your faculty.
- AI tools deliver results that have been synthesized and averaged from many non citable sources. Misrepresentations are easy to miss.
- The AI tech space is rapidly changing and will continue to be contested. Be discerning in how you use these tools.
- Remember why you are at Parsons - to invest in yourself as a creative. Explore these tools with curiosity and criticality, rather than dependency.

**Faculty Specific policy about the use of AI and generative tools:**

Students may use AI as a learning assistant to clarify code or brainstorm, but **no final work (text, code, or images) generated by AI may be submitted** as your own without written permission. All code submitted must be written and understood by you. You will be expected to explain your code and problem-solving process during critiques and reviews.

---

## Academic Honesty and Integrity

Compromising your academic integrity may lead to serious consequences, including (but not limited to) one or more of the following: failure of the assignment, failure of the course, academic warning, disciplinary probation, suspension from the university, or dismissal from the university.

Students are responsible for understanding the University's policy on academic honesty and integrity and must make use of proper citations of sources for writing papers, creating, presenting, and performing their work, taking examinations, and doing research. It is the responsibility of students to learn the procedures specific to their discipline for correctly and appropriately differentiating their own work from that of others. The full text of the policy, including adjudication procedures, is found on the university website under [Policies: A to Z](https://www.newschool.edu/student-conduct/policies/). Resources regarding what plagiarism is and how to avoid it can be found on the [Learning Center's website](https://www.newschool.edu/learning-center/).

The New School views "academic honesty and integrity" as the duty of every member of an academic community to claim authorship for his or her own work and only for that work, and to recognize the contributions of others accurately and completely. This obligation is fundamental to the integrity of intellectual debate, and creative and academic pursuits. Academic honesty and integrity includes accurate use of quotations, as well as appropriate and explicit citation of sources in instances of paraphrasing and describing ideas, or reporting on research findings or any aspect of the work of others (including that of faculty members and other students). Academic dishonesty results from infractions of this "accurate use". The standards of academic honesty and integrity, and citation of sources, apply to all forms of academic work, including submissions of drafts of final papers or projects. All members of the University community are expected to conduct themselves in accord with the standards of academic honesty and integrity. Please see the complete policy in the Parsons Catalog.

---

## Intellectual Property Rights

The New School (the "university") seeks to encourage creativity and invention among its faculty members and students. In doing so, the University affirms its traditional commitment to the personal ownership by its faculty members and students of Intellectual Property Rights in works they create. The complete policy governing Intellectual Property Rights may be seen on the university website, on the [Provost's page](https://www.newschool.edu/provost/policies/).

---

## Student Course Ratings (Course Evaluations)

During the last two weeks of the semester, students are asked to provide feedback for each of their courses through an online survey. They cannot view grades until providing feedback or officially declining to do so. Course evaluations are a vital space where students can speak about the learning experience. It is an important process which provides valuable data about the successful delivery and support of a course or topic to both the faculty and administrators. Instructors rely on course rating surveys for feedback on the course and teaching methods, so they can understand what aspects of the class are most successful in teaching students, and what aspects might be improved or changed in future. Without this information, it can be difficult for an instructor to reflect upon and improve teaching methods and course design. In addition, program/department chairs and other administrators review course surveys. Instructions are available online [here](https://www.newschool.edu/registrar/course-evaluations/).
