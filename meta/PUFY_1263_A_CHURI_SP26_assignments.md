## Assignment Overview

This course includes a series of scaffolded assignments designed to build your skills progressively throughout the semester. Each assignment contributes to your final project: a functional electronic object designed for a speculative future scenario. Assignments are intentionally kept manageable to allow you to focus on learning fundamentals while exploring creative possibilities.

---

## 1. Lab Safety Orientation
**Due:** Week 1 (Jan 26)
**Weight:** Mandatory (no separate grade)

Complete the Making Center safety orientation to gain access to lab equipment, soldering stations, and fabrication tools. This is required before you can use any Making Center facilities.

**Deliverable:** Confirmation of completed orientation

---

## 2. User Persona
**Due:** Week 2 (Feb 2) — Draft
**Due:** Week 7 (Mar 23) — Final with User Journey
**Weight:** 10% (combined with User Journey)

Create a detailed user persona for someone living in a utopian or dystopian future scenario. Your persona should include demographics, goals, frustrations, daily routines, and environmental context. This persona will guide the design of your final electronic object.

**Deliverable:**
- Draft: 1-page persona document with basic demographic and behavioral information
- Final: Refined persona integrated with your user journey (see Assignment #7)

**Tips:** Keep it simple but specific. Focus on 2-3 key characteristics that will inform your object design.

---

## 3. Python Fundamentals App
**Due:** Week 3 (Feb 9)
**Weight:** 10%

Write a simple Python application that demonstrates your understanding of variables, conditionals (if/else), and basic logic. The program should solve a simple problem or respond to user input.

**Requirements:**
- Use at least 3 variables
- Include at least 1 conditional statement
- Include comments explaining your code
- Run without errors

**Deliverable:** Python file (.py) with commented code, submitted via Canvas

**Example ideas:** Temperature converter, simple quiz, age calculator, decision-making tool

---

## 4. Circuit Prototype Plan
**Due:** Week 4 (Feb 23)
**Weight:** Part of Electronic Circuit assignment (10% total)

Design a simple circuit plan that uses LEDs, resistors, and a power source. This plan will help you think through the electrical components of your eventual electronic object.

**Deliverable:**
- Hand-drawn or digital circuit diagram
- List of components needed
- Brief description (3-4 sentences) of what the circuit does

**Tips:** Start simple. A circuit with 2-3 LEDs and basic on/off functionality is sufficient.

---

## 5. Object Concept Sketches
**Due:** Week 5 (Mar 2)
**Weight:** 10% (combined with Presentation)

Create visual sketches exploring what your electronic object might look like and how it would be used. Think about form, function, and how it fits into your user's life in their future scenario.

**Deliverable:**
- 3-5 sketches showing different angles or concepts
- Brief annotations explaining key features
- Can be hand-drawn or digital

**Tips:** Don't worry about artistic skill. Focus on communicating ideas clearly.

---

## 6. Concept Sell Sheet
**Due:** Week 6 (Mar 9)
**Weight:** Part of presentation grade

Create a one-page visual "sell sheet" that presents your object concept as if you were pitching it to stakeholders. This helps you clarify your concept and practice professional presentation skills.

**Deliverable:**
- Single-page document (digital or physical)
- Include: object name, key features, user benefit, and at least one image/sketch
- Clear, concise language

---

## 7. User Journey Map
**Due:** Week 7 (Mar 23)
**Weight:** 10% (combined with Persona)

Map out a typical day or key scenario in your user persona's life, showing touchpoints where your electronic object would be used. This helps you understand context and identify design opportunities.

**Deliverable:**
- Visual timeline or journey map
- 5-8 key moments/touchpoints
- Indication of where your object fits in
- Emotions/pain points noted

**Format:** Can be hand-drawn, digital diagram, or simple timeline with annotations

---

## 8. Working Prototype Presentation
**Due:** Week 9 (Apr 6)
**Weight:** Part of presentation grade

Present a working prototype of your electronic object. It doesn't need to be complete, but should demonstrate basic functionality (code + circuit working together).

**Requirements:**
- Functioning code on microcontroller
- Basic circuit operational
- 2-3 minute presentation explaining what it does and how it relates to your user persona

**Deliverable:** In-class demonstration and brief presentation

---

## 9. Enclosure/Housing Build
**Due:** Week 10 (Apr 13)
**Weight:** Part of Final Project (20%)

Build a physical enclosure for your electronic object using cardboard, found materials, or simple fabrication techniques. The enclosure should protect the electronics and reflect the design aesthetic of your concept.

**Requirements:**
- Enclosure fits all electronic components
- Access for USB connection/power
- Consider user interaction (buttons, sensors, display visibility)

**Deliverable:** Physical enclosure, brought to class

---

## 10. Fully Assembled Object
**Due:** Week 11 (Apr 20)
**Weight:** Part of Final Project (20%)

Integrate your circuit, code, and enclosure into a complete, functional object. All components should be properly connected (soldered where appropriate), and the object should work reliably.

**Requirements:**
- Code runs correctly on microcontroller
- All electronic connections secure
- Enclosure properly houses components
- Object functions as designed

**Deliverable:** Complete physical object

---

## 11. User Testing Results
**Due:** Week 12 (Apr 27)
**Weight:** Part of Final Project (20%)

Conduct peer user testing with at least 2 classmates. Document their feedback and your observations about how people interact with your object.

**Deliverable:**
- Brief testing report (1-2 pages)
- Document what worked, what didn't, and what you learned
- Include any changes made based on feedback

**Format:** Simple written document or annotated photos/video
