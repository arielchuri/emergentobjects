## Course Description

Program, fabricate, and document electronic objects and build a better future.
Gain an understanding of tactile, human-computer interfaces by producing evocative and functional devices of your own design.

Design is the process of actualizing change to our current state.
By imagining a potential future, we can create a context for designed objects that reflect on our current circumstances.

We will develop working hardware devices that respond to user input in this hands-on, project-based class.
We will begin by understanding the process of creating a compelling user experience and learn how to document and present a research-based approach to design. 

We'll go through electrical engineering fundamentals, circuit design, and electronic component prototyping.
Our knowledge of electricity will allow us to create sensors that interact with the human body.

We will cover the basics of coding and working with micro-controllers. By programming the brains of our object we will use the data from our sensors to create a responsive device.

User testing and documentation are a vital step in the creation of complex objects. We will explore the process of pitching and defending our work as an aid to the design process.

We will design and create our products individually, but meet in small groups to critique each other's work. Bi-weekly technical lectures will be supported by short learning assignments to be completed in pairs.

## Learning Outcomes

By the successful completion of this course, students will be able, at *an introductory level,* to:

1. Think critically about the designed object and learn to reflect this thinking in their own designs.
2. Create documentation justifying their designs.
3. Create and modify the possible interfaces between the physical and digital.
4. Use design research methodologies that require a playful and/or experimental approach to the design process.
5. Use modern, user experience design practices.
6. Gain proficiency in modeling, sketching, and prototyping.
7. Pitch, present, and defend their work.
8. Reflect on their own learning in posts on the Parsons Learning Portfolio.

## Learning Portfolio

You will use the Parsons Learning Portfolio throughout your education at
Parsons. It is an ongoing, cumulative repository for your creative
development and experience across courses, and across years. It archives
your working process, skills learned, and connections you make between
assignments, courses, and years, as well as final "finished" work. The
courses in the first year emphasize the process -- how you started, what
happened next (and why), and how you ended up at your final work for
each project.

Showing preliminary work (sketches, drafts, notes, research, etc.) as
well as final documentation of your work will help to tell your story
and make connections that may not have otherwise been apparent. In
Integrative Seminar and Studio, the Parsons Learning Portfolio will
serve as a bridging mechanism to aid conversation and provide access to
projects and writings across the seminar and studio, and stimulate
critically reflective learning, thinking, writing and making.

**Make sure to use the MANDATORY Parsons Learning Portfolio Template**-
and do not change the template as this is a shared component of the
Parsons experience. Also please **add a Learning Portfolio link to
your**[**
**](http://guides.instructure.com/m/4212/l/75098?data-resolve-url=true&data-manual-id=4212)[***Canvas
Bio***](http://guides.instructure.com/m/4212/l/75098?data-resolve-url=true&data-manual-id=4212)**.**
This allows fellow students and faculty to access your portfolio.

## Materials and Supplies

Please note that there are materials costs associated with this studio
course and you should expect to purchase up to \$50 on supplies. The
expected cost does not include printer points that you receive as a
student, nor does it include the materials from the materials kit that
is purchased as you enter the first year. You can find a list of the
materials kit items on the First Year advising page:[
](http://www.newschool.edu/parsons/academic-advising-first-year-students/)[*http://www.newschool.edu/parsons/academic-advising-first-year-students/*](http://www.newschool.edu/parsons/academic-advising-first-year-students/)

**Learning Together/Community Agreement**

- Zoom Classes: As in a traditional classroom setting, our class time together is valuable. While in class, I ask that you concentrate exclusively on our conversation and activities. Do not allow yourself to get distracted by other activities on your screen(s) and beyond.
- All classroom interactions should be in support of group and individual learning. Please reach out to me via email churia@newschool.edu if you have any concerns about the learning environment or “classroom” dynamics. NOTE: You will receive ZOOM invite from me via an email before this date.
- Keep in mind...No one knows everything, everyone knows something, together we know a lot: This means we all get to practice being humble, because we have something to learn from everyone in the “room”. It also means we all have a responsibility to share what we know, as wellas our question, so that others may learn from us.   
  We can’t be articulate all the time & will make mistakes: As much as we’d like, we just can’t. Often people feel hesitant to participate in a workshop or meeting or express ones comments for fear of “messing up” or stumbling over their words. We want everyone to feel comfortable participating, even if you can’t be as articulate as you’d like. We have the opportunity to use several way to communicate; Canvas, in-person, and Zoom. We will use all three in this class when needed.
- Take care of yourself and each other.

## Grading and Evaluation

Students' ability to meet the course's learning outcomes will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

-   Attend regularly and communicate any challenge or absences to their faculty
-   Solve problems, both creative and technical through an iterative process
-   Turn in project assignments and course material on time
-   Document their research in the development of projects
-   Describe the the cross-course exploration between the Studio and Seminar
-   Participate in class discussions and critiques
-   Be accountable in collaborative work
-   Improve in technical, creative, and problem solving abilities
-   Submit thoughtful studio works that have undertaken several stages
    of ideation.

### About Attendance and Grading

Your final grade will be calculated based on class participation (40%
total) and projects (60% total). The following grade calculation
demonstrates the need for your consistent participation, and equally as
important, your active engagement in each step of the learning process.
Weekly participation will allow you to successfully complete course
projects and to contribute to our learning community.

Students who must miss a class session should notify the instructor and
make up any missed work as soon as possible- ideally in an email prior
to the class meeting. The student is responsible for following the
course on Canvas and continuing to meet due dates, regardless of
absences. A student who anticipates an extended absence should
immediately inform the faculty and his or her program advisor.

(For more information on attendance see the University Policies below)

# UNIVERSITY POLICY & RESOURCES

## **Resources**

The university provides many resources to help students achieve academic
and artistic excellence. These resources include:

-   [***The University (and associated)
    Libraries***](https://library.newschool.edu/)
-   [***The University Learning
    Center***](https://www.newschool.edu/university-learning-center/)
-   [***University Disabilities
    Service***](https://www.newschool.edu/student-disability-services/)**s**

In keeping with the university\'s policy of providing equal access for
students with disabilities, any student with a disability who needs
academic accommodations must contact SDS. There are several ways for
students to contact the office: via email at
StudentDisability\@newschool.edu, through the Starfish service catalog,
or by calling the office at 212.229.5626. A self-ID form can also be
completed on the SDS webpage at
www.newschool.edu/student-disability-services. Once you contact the
office, SDS staff will arrange an intake appointment to discuss your
concerns and, if appropriate, provide you with accommodation notices to
give to me. Please note that faculty will not work unilaterally with
students to provide accommodations. If you inform me of a disability but
do not provide any official notification, I must refer you to SDS.

-   [***Making Center***](http://resources.parsons.edu/)

The Making Center is a constellation of shops, labs, and open workspaces
that are situated across the New School to help students express their
ideas in a variety of materials and methods. We have resources to help
support woodworking, metalworking, ceramics and pottery work,
photography and film, textiles, printmaking, 3D printing, manual and CNC
machining, and more. A staff of technicians and student workers provide
expertise and maintain the different shops and labs. Safety is a primary
concern, so each area has policies for access, training, and etiquette
with which students and faculty should be familiar. Many areas require
specific orientations or training before access is granted.

-   [***Health and
    Wellness***](https://www.newschool.edu/campus-community/health-wellness-support/):
    additional services and support available to New School students.

## **Grading Standards**

### **Undergraduate**

A student's final grades and GPA are calculated using a 4.0 scale.

A \[4.0\] Work of exceptional quality, which often goes beyond the
stated goals of the course (95-100%)

A- \[3.7\] Work of very high quality (90% - \<95%)

B+ \[3.3\] Work of high quality that indicates higher than average
abilities (87% - \<90%)

B \[3.0\] Very good work that satisfies the goals of the course (83% -
\<87%)

B- \[2.7\] Good work (80% - \<83%)

C+ \[2.3\] Above-average work (77% - \<80%)

C \[2.0\] Average work that indicates an understanding of the course
material; passable (73% - \<77%);\
Satisfactory completion of a course is considered to be a grade of C or
higher.

C- \[1.7\] Passing work but below good academic standing (70% - \<73%)

D \[1.0\] Below-average work that indicates a student does not fully
understand the assignments (60% - \<70%); Probation level though passing
for credit

F \[0.0\] Failure, no credit (0% - \<60%)

GM Grade missing for an individual

## **Grade of W**

The grade of W may be issued by the Office of the Registrar to a student
who officially withdraws from a course within the applicable deadline.
There is no academic penalty, but the grade will appear on the student
transcript.\

## **Unofficial Withdrawal (Grade of Z)**

This grade is to be assigned to students who have **never attended or
stopped attending** classes. Exceptions can be made if the student has
completed enough work to warrant a grade (including a failing grade),
and arrangements have been made with the instructor(s) and the Dean's
Office prior to grade submission. The Z grade does not calculate into
the student's GPA. Though a Z grade does not have a failing penalty it
still carries a myriad of consequences for students on visas or
receiving financial aid. Only issue the Z grade when a student meets the
above criteria.

## **Grades of Incomplete **

The grade of I, or temporary incomplete, may be granted to a student
under unusual and extenuating circumstances, such as when the student's
academic life is interrupted by a medical or personal emergency. This
mark is not given automatically but only upon the student's request and
at the discretion of the instructor. A Request for Incomplete form must
be completed and signed by the student and instructor. The time allowed
for completion of the work and removal of the "I" mark will be set by
the instructor with the following limitations:

### **Undergraduate students:** Work must be completed no later than the
seventh week of the following fall semester for spring or summer term
incompletes and no later than the seventh week of the following spring
semester for fall term incompletes. Grades of "I" not revised in the
prescribed time will be recorded as a final grade of "F" by the
Registrar's Office.

## **College, School, Program and Class Policies**

A comprehensive overview of policy may be found under [*Policies: A to
Z*](https://www.newschool.edu/about/university-resources/policies/).
Students are also encouraged to consult the [*Academic Catalog for
Parsons*](https://www.newschool.edu/provost/academic-catalogs/).

**Canvas**

Use of Canvas may be an important resource for this class. Students
should check it for announcements before coming to class each week.

**Electronic Devices**

The use of electronic devices (phones, tablets, laptops, cameras, etc.)
is permitted when the device is being used in relation to the course\'s
work. All other uses are prohibited in the classroom and devices should
be turned off before class starts.

**Responsibility**

Students are responsible for all assignments, even if they are absent.
Late assignments, failure to complete the assignments for class
discussion and/or critique, and lack of preparedness for in-class
discussions, presentations and/or critiques will jeopardize your
successful completion of this course.

**Active Participation and Attendance**

Class participation is an essential part of class and includes: keeping
up with reading, assignments, projects, contributing meaningfully to
class discussions, active participation in group work, and attending
synchronous sessions regularly and on time.

Parsons' attendance guidelines were developed to encourage students'
success in all aspects of their academic programs. Full participation is
essential to the successful completion of coursework and enhances the
quality of the educational experience for all, particularly in courses
where group work is integral; thus, Parsons promotes high levels of
attendance. Students are expected to attend classes regularly and
promptly and in compliance with the standards stated in this course
syllabus.

While attendance is just one aspect of active participation, absence
from a significant portion of class time may prevent the successful
attainment of course objectives. A significant portion of class time is
generally defined as the equivalent of three weeks, or 20%, of class
time. Lateness or early departure from class may be recorded as one full
absence. Students may be asked to withdraw from a course if habitual
absenteeism or tardiness has a negative impact on the class environment.

I will assess each student's performance against all of the assessment
criteria in determining your final grade. \[Students are expected to
keep up with class activities and requirements each week. Also, describe
additional expectations for meaningful participation. If students are
unable to join synchronous sessions, how will they access the content
and materials covered during the session so that they can keep up and
"make-up" this absence? How will faculty and students interact on Zoom?
Use the chat feature? Etc.\]

**Recording Synchronous Sessions**

Virtual classes and, possibly, lectures or in-person classes, will be recorded and the recording will available only to your classmates. These recordings will be deleted 30 days after they are created.

**Academic Honesty and Integrity**

Compromising your academic integrity may lead to serious consequences,
including (but not limited to) one or more of the following: failure of
the assignment, failure of the course, academic warning, disciplinary
probation, suspension from the university, or dismissal from the
university.

Students are responsible for understanding the University's policy on
academic honesty and integrity and must make use of proper citations of
sources for writing papers, creating, presenting, and performing their
work, taking examinations, and doing research. It is the responsibility
of students to learn the procedures specific to their discipline for
correctly and appropriately differentiating their own work from that of
others. The full text of the policy, including adjudication procedures,
is found on the university website under [*Policies: A to
Z*](https://www.newschool.edu/about/university-resources/policies/).
Resources regarding what plagiarism is and how to avoid it can be found
on the [*Learning Center's
website*](https://www.newschool.edu/learning-center/resources-workshops/).

The New School views "academic honesty and integrity" as the duty of
every member of an academic community to claim authorship for his or her
own work and only for that work, and to recognize the contributions of
others accurately and completely. This obligation is fundamental to the
integrity of intellectual debate, and creative and academic pursuits.
Academic honesty and integrity includes accurate use of quotations, as
well as appropriate and explicit citation of sources in instances of
paraphrasing and describing ideas, or reporting on research findings or
any aspect of the work of others (including that of faculty members and
other students). Academic dishonesty results from infractions of this
"accurate use". The standards of academic honesty and integrity, and
citation of sources, apply to all forms of academic work, including
submissions of drafts of final papers or projects. All members of the
University community are expected to conduct themselves in accord with
the standards of academic honesty and integrity. Please see the complete
policy in the Parsons Catalog.

[]{#anchor-17}**Intellectual Property Rights**

[]{#anchor-18}The New School (the \"university\") seeks to encourage
creativity and invention among its faculty members and students. In
doing so, the University affirms its traditional commitment to the
personal ownership by its faculty members and students of Intellectual
Property Rights in works they create. The complete policy governing
Intellectual Property Rights may be seen on the [*university website, on
the Provost's
page*](https://www.newschool.edu/provost/accreditation-policies/).

**Student Course Ratings (Course Evaluations)**

[]{#anchor-20}During the last two weeks of the semester, students are
asked to provide feedback for each of their courses through an online
survey. They cannot view grades until providing feedback or officially
declining to do so. Course evaluations are a vital space where students
can speak about the learning experience. It is an important process
which provides valuable data about the successful delivery and support
of a course or topic to both the faculty and administrators. Instructors
rely on course rating surveys for feedback on the course and teaching
methods, so they can understand what aspects of the class are most
successful in teaching students, and what aspects might be improved or
changed in future. Without this information, it can be difficult for an
instructor to reflect upon and improve teaching methods and course
design. In addition, program/department chairs and other administrators
review course surveys. Instructions are available online
[*here.*](#_3dy6vkm)
