# Circuit Playground Intro

## Overview

We will connect our microcontroller to any inputs, such as buttons and sensors, and outputs, such a lights, motors, and speakers. We will program our microcontroller to use the devices.

We program our microcontroller by editing a text file on our computer and loading onto the microcontroller. This requires a USB cable to connect our computer to the microcontroller and an application to edit the text file and upload it. The first step is to follow the directions for your microcontroller. I have included the appropriate tutorials below.

## Connecting to a circuit

The next step is to connect your MC to circuit. Attempt the following circuits.

- Blink an LED (digital output)
- Sense a button (digital input)
- Sense a potentiometer (analog input)
- Fade on LED (analog output)
