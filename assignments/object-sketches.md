# Object Sketches

**Week:** Assigned Week 4, Due Week 5
**Due:** Mar 2
**Weight:** Part of Object Sketches & Presentation (10%)

## Learning Outcomes

This assignment maps to the following learning outcomes:

- **LO 3 - Experimentation:** Play with the concept of a "fantastic object" and experiment with non-traditional human-object interactions through play and discovery.
- **LO 5 - Broad Application:** Use speculative scenarios to inspire creative problem-solving across art, design, and strategic thinking fields.

## Description

Create multiple conceptual sketches exploring the form, function, and interaction design of your emergent object. These sketches will help you visualize and refine your ideas before building prototypes.

## Requirements

- Produce at least 6-10 sketches showing:
  - Different views and angles of your object
  - How users interact with it
  - Key features and components
  - Size and scale (with dimensions or scale reference)
  - Different design variations or iterations
- Include annotations explaining features and interactions
- Show how your object relates to your persona and scenario
- At least 3 different design concepts to explore options

## Deliverables

- 6-10 sketches (can be hand-drawn, digital, or mixed)
- Annotations and labels on sketches
- Brief written description (200-300 words) explaining:
  - Your design rationale
  - How it serves your persona
  - What makes it an "emergent" or "fantastic" object
  - Which concept you're leaning toward and why
- Upload scans/photos to Canvas

## Grading Rubric

This assignment is part of the **Object Sketches & Presentation** category (10% of final grade).

| Criteria | A (95-100%) | A- / B+ (87-94%) | B / B- (80-86%) | C+ / C (73-79%) | Below C (< 73%) |
|----------|-------------|------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Creativity & Exploration (30%)** | Exceptional range and creativity; explores innovative, diverse concepts; pushes boundaries; demonstrates imaginative thinking; multiple compelling design directions | Strong creativity; explores good variety of concepts; shows originality; demonstrates solid creative thinking; several good directions | Adequate creativity; explores some variety; shows basic originality; demonstrates acceptable thinking; a few directions explored | Limited creativity; minimal variety; shows little originality; stays with obvious ideas; few directions | No meaningful creativity or exploration; no variety |
| **Clarity of Communication (25%)** | Exceptionally clear, professional sketches; excellent annotations; easy to understand design intent; proper use of drawing conventions; multiple views and details | Clear, well-executed sketches; good annotations; understandable design; appropriate drawing conventions; multiple views | Adequate sketches; acceptable annotations; design is understandable; basic conventions; some views shown | Unclear sketches; poor annotations; difficult to understand; weak drawing; minimal views | Incomprehensible or missing sketches; no meaningful communication |
| **User Interaction (20%)** | Demonstrates sophisticated understanding of interaction design; clearly shows how users engage; considers ergonomics, accessibility, and experience; innovative interaction concepts | Demonstrates solid understanding of interaction; shows user engagement well; considers key factors; good interaction concepts | Demonstrates basic understanding; shows basic user engagement; considers some factors; acceptable interaction | Demonstrates limited understanding; minimal consideration of interaction; unclear how users engage | No meaningful consideration of user interaction |
| **Connection to Concept (15%)** | Brilliantly connected to persona and scenario; design choices clearly serve user needs; strong conceptual coherence; speculative context integral to design | Well-connected to persona and scenario; design serves user needs; good conceptual coherence; context evident in design | Adequately connected; addresses basic user needs; some conceptual coherence; context present | Weakly connected; minimal consideration of user/scenario; limited conceptual coherence | No meaningful connection to persona or scenario |
| **Quantity & Quality (10%)** | 10+ high-quality sketches; exceptional detail and refinement; shows extensive exploration; professional presentation | 8-9 quality sketches; good detail; shows solid exploration; well-presented | 6-7 adequate sketches; acceptable detail; shows basic exploration; reasonably presented | 4-5 minimal sketches; limited detail; minimal exploration; poor presentation | Fewer than 4 sketches or severely inadequate quality |

### Deliverables Checklist
- [ ] Minimum 6-10 sketches total
- [ ] Multiple views/angles of object(s)
- [ ] Annotations explaining features
- [ ] Scale or dimensions indicated
- [ ] At least 3 different design concepts
- [ ] Shows user interaction
- [ ] Written description (200-300 words)
- [ ] Uploaded to Canvas

### Assessment Focus
- **Ideation process:** Generating many ideas before committing
- **Visual thinking:** Using drawing to develop and communicate ideas
- **Design refinement:** Iterating and improving concepts
- **Foundation for making:** These sketches will guide your prototype

### What Makes Sketches Successful
- Show thinking and exploration, not just final ideas
- Include rough sketches AND more refined drawings
- Annotate to clarify what can't be shown visually
- Consider all aspects: form, function, interaction, materiality
- Think about your persona using the object

## Resources

- Lecture: Code meets electricity - Week 4
- See finalproject directory for previous examples
- Sketching and ideation techniques (Canvas)

## Tips

- Don't worry about artistic perfection - clarity matters more
- Sketch quickly and generate many ideas before refining
- Consider unconventional forms and interactions
- Think about all sensory modes (visual, tactile, auditory)
- Show your sketches to others for feedback
- Consider materials and fabrication methods as you sketch
- Include human figures for scale reference
