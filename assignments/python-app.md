# Python Application

**Week:** Assigned Week 2, Due Week 3
**Due:** Feb 9
**Weight:** 10%

## Learning Outcomes

This assignment maps to the following learning outcomes:

- **LO 2 - Tools, Materials, Methods:** Write and debug basic Python code and create electronic circuits using microprocessors.

## Description

Create a functional Python application that demonstrates your understanding of programming fundamentals including variables, conditions, and basic logic. This assignment will prepare you for coding microcontrollers later in the semester.

## Requirements

- Write a Python program that:
  - Uses variables to store data
  - Implements conditional logic (if/else statements)
  - Takes user input
  - Produces meaningful output
- Code must be well-commented explaining your logic
- Program must run without errors
- Demonstrate understanding of basic programming concepts

## Suggested Project Ideas

- Interactive quiz or decision tree
- Simple calculator or converter
- Logic puzzle solver
- Text-based game or story
- Data processor or analyzer

## Deliverables

- Python (.py) file uploaded to Canvas
- Brief description (100-200 words) explaining:
  - What your program does
  - How to use it
  - What programming concepts you applied
  - Any challenges you encountered

## Grading Rubric

This assignment is worth **10% of your final grade**.

| Criteria | A (95-100%) | A- / B+ (87-94%) | B / B- (80-86%) | C+ / C (73-79%) | Below C (< 73%) |
|----------|-------------|------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Functionality (40%)** | Program runs flawlessly; exceeds requirements; handles edge cases; robust and error-free; demonstrates sophisticated logic | Program runs well; meets all requirements; handles most inputs correctly; few minor issues; solid implementation | Program runs with requirements mostly met; handles basic inputs; some bugs or limitations; functional but not polished | Program runs with significant issues; meets some requirements; limited functionality; multiple bugs | Program does not run or fails to meet basic requirements |
| **Code Quality (30%)** | Exceptionally clean, readable code; excellent variable names; comprehensive, helpful comments; professional structure and organization | Clean, well-organized code; good variable names; clear comments throughout; good structure | Readable code; acceptable variable names; adequate comments; basic organization | Messy or confusing code; poor variable names; minimal comments; weak organization | Unreadable code; no meaningful comments; poor or no structure |
| **Programming Concepts (20%)** | Demonstrates sophisticated understanding of variables, conditions, and logic; creative use of programming concepts; shows exploration beyond basics | Demonstrates solid understanding; effective use of variables and conditionals; shows good grasp of concepts | Demonstrates basic understanding; uses variables and conditionals adequately; meets basic expectations | Demonstrates limited understanding; minimal use of concepts; barely meets requirements | Does not demonstrate understanding of required concepts |
| **Documentation (10%)** | Excellent written explanation; clear instructions; thorough description of logic and challenges; professional presentation | Good written explanation; clear instructions; describes logic and process well | Adequate explanation; basic instructions; describes program function | Minimal explanation; unclear instructions; limited description | Missing or inadequate documentation |

### Additional Considerations
- **Iteration & Problem-Solving:** Evidence of testing, debugging, and refinement
- **Creativity:** Original or interesting approach to the assignment
- **Technical Ambition:** Taking on appropriate challenges beyond minimum requirements

### Late Submission Policy
- Submit on time for full credit
- Late submissions may be penalized per course policy
- Contact instructor in advance if you need support

### Code Submission Requirements
- Submit .py file that runs without errors
- Include your name and date in code comments
- Test your code before submission
- Include written description (100-200 words)

## Resources

- Demo: Basic Python (Variables/Conditions) - Week 2
- Workshop: Logic puzzles - Week 2
- Python documentation
- Course programming materials in programming_intro directory

## Tips

- Start simple and add complexity gradually
- Test your code frequently as you write
- Use meaningful variable names
- Comment your code as you write, not after
- Ask for help in office hours if you get stuck
- Try running your code with different inputs to test edge cases
