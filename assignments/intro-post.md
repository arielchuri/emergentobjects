## Requirements

### 1. Photo
Include a photo of yourself. It can be:
- A selfie
- A recent photo
- An action shot doing something you love
- A creative self-portrait
- You with an object that's important to you

### 2. Basic Info
Share some (not all) of the following:
- Your name and pronouns
- Where you're from or where you're based now
- Your major or area of interest
- Why you're taking this course
- Previous experience with coding, electronics, or making (or total lack thereof!)
- A hobby, passion, or interest outside of school

### 3. The Improv Element

**Choose ONE of the following prompts:**

#### Option A: Object as Origin Story
Describe yourself through an everyday object that shaped who you are.

*Example: "I am a Nintendo Game Boy because I'm portable, pixelated, and require AA batteries (coffee) to function properly."*

#### Option B: Future Self Introduction
Introduce yourself as if you're posting from 10 years in the future. What are you working on? Where do you live? What problem are you trying to solve?

*Example: "Hi, I'm Jordan, posting from 2036 where I design atmospheric processors for underground cities. I'm taking this course to understand the vintage 2026 technology we now use in retro installations..."*

#### Option C: Two Truths and a Fabrication
Share three statements about yourself. Two are true, one is completely made up. Classmates can guess which is the fabrication in responses.

*Example:*
1. *I once performed in a flash mob at Grand Central Station*
2. *I can solve a Rubik's cube in under 30 seconds*
3. *I have a collection of 47 vintage calculators*

#### Option D: Your Personal Object
If you could create any electronic object for yourself (realistic or fantastical), what would it do and why would you need it?

*Example: "I'd create a 'Social Battery Indicator' that glows different colors based on my energy levels, so people know when I need quiet time versus when I'm ready to chat."*

## Tips

- Be yourself! Authenticity > polish
- Have fun with the improv element
- Read and respond to at least 2 classmates' posts
- This is about building community, not being evaluated on writing skills
- If you're uncomfortable sharing a photo of your face, a creative alternative is fine

## Why We're Doing This

This course involves collaboration, critique, and creative risk-taking. Getting to know each other early helps build trust and makes the classroom a better place for experimentation and learning. Plus, the improv prompts get us thinking about objects, futures, and personas — themes we'll explore all semester.

## Example Post

**[Photo of person holding a vintage camera]**

Hi! I'm Sam (they/them), a first-year undecided major from Portland. I'm taking Emergent Objects because I want to learn how technology works beyond just using apps. Zero coding experience but I love taking things apart (and occasionally putting them back together).

**Future Self:** It's 2036, and I'm Sam, a repair cafe coordinator in the Pacific Northwest. We teach people to fix their banned devices from the Great Obsolescence Act of 2029. I'm revisiting this 2026 course because microcontrollers became precious after the semiconductor shortage, and I need to remember how the old Raspberry Pi Picos worked!

Looking forward to meeting everyone!
