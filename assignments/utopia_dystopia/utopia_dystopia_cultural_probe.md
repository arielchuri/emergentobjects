# Utopia Dystopia Cultural Probe

Create a fictional cultural probe to explore your imaginary society.

1. Decide upon a particular utopia or dystopia. Imagine a person in that society.

2. Choose one of the below *design research methodologies* and create a short, fictional response. A photo and two paragraphs would be enough. 
   Imagine you are researching a real person using one of these methods. You are creating an artifact of that (imaginary) research.
