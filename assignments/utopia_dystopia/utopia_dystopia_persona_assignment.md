# Assignment: Utopia/Dystopia World & User Persona

**Due Dates:**
- **Draft:** Week 2 (Feb 2) — Submit to Learning Portfolio
- **Final:** Week 7 (Mar 23) — Updated in Learning Portfolio with User Journey

**Weight:** 10% (combined with User Journey)

## Overview

Design doesn't happen in a vacuum. Every object we create is shaped by the world it exists in — the environment, the culture, the technologies, and the problems people face. In this assignment, you'll imagine a future world (either utopian or dystopian) and create a person who lives there. This speculative foundation will guide everything you make this semester.

Your electronic object will be designed for this person, in this world. The more specific and thoughtful your world-building is now, the more interesting your final project will be.

---

## Why Are We Doing This?

Speculative design asks "what if?" rather than "what is." By imagining futures that don't exist yet, we can:
- **Explore possibilities** — both hopeful and cautionary
- **Challenge assumptions** about how technology should work
- **Design with purpose** — creating objects that address real needs (even if the world is imaginary)
- **Practice empathy** — understanding how different contexts shape what people need

---

## The Assignment

Create a speculative future scenario and a detailed persona for someone living in that world. You'll submit this as a post in your Learning Portfolio.

### Part 1: Build Your World

Choose: **Utopia or Dystopia?**

Then answer these questions:

1. **What is your world/nation called?** (Give it a name)
2. **When/where is it?** 
3. **What makes it utopian or dystopian?** (List 3-5 specific aspects)
   - Technology that exists (or doesn't)
   - Environmental conditions
   - Social structures
   - Daily life differences from today
4. **What's one problem people in this world face?** (Even utopias have challenges)

**Think about:**
- Climate and environment
- How people communicate
- What resources are scarce or abundant
- What technology is common or forbidden
- What people value or fear

### Part 2: Create Your Persona

Imagine one specific person who lives in your world. Give them:

**Basic Info:**
- Name
- Age
- Occupation (what do people do in your world?)
- Living situation (alone? with others? in what kind of space?)

**Character:**
- What are their daily routines?
- What frustrates them?
- What are they trying to achieve?
- What technologies do they interact with?
- What makes them unique?

**Visual:**
- Include at least one image: sketch, mood board, photo collage,

**The Key Question:**
What electronic object would make this person's life better, easier, or more meaningful in their world?

**Update your original post:**
- Refined and expanded world description (400-600 words total)

- Integration with your User Journey Map (posted separately or in same post)
- Clear connection to your electronic object concept

## Examples & Inspiration

### Utopian Examples:
- **"SolarPunk City 2080"** — A city powered entirely by renewable energy where people grow food on every rooftop and building. Persona: A rooftop farmer who manages 5 buildings' gardens and needs help tracking soil health and coordinating harvest sharing.

- **"The Care Collective"** — A society where AI has eliminated tedious work and people spend their time on creative and care-giving pursuits. Persona: An elderly person who teaches traditional crafts to children via holographic studio sessions but struggles to feel physically present.

### Dystopian Examples:
- **"Firewall City"** — A world where climate collapse has made outdoors uninhabitable and everyone lives in sealed mega-structures. Persona: A maintenance worker who repairs the building's air filtration but has no way to know when filters are failing before people get sick.

- **"The Attention Wars"** — A surveillance society where every moment is monetized and tracked. Persona: A teenager trying to have private thoughts in a world where neural implants broadcast your emotional state to advertisers.

## Tips for Success

**Do:**
- ✅ Be specific. "Post-apocalyptic" is vague. "Brooklyn after 30 years of flooding" is specific.
- ✅ Make it believable within its own logic. Even wild futures have internal consistency.
- ✅ Think about sensory details. What does your world smell like? Sound like?
- ✅ Focus on one person deeply rather than describing everyone
- ✅ Consider what your persona does on a Tuesday afternoon, not just dramatic moments

**Don't:**
- ❌ Make it too complicated. You're writing a design brief, not a novel.
- ❌ Forget that even dystopias have moments of joy and even utopias have challenges
- ❌ Create a persona who's just "you but in the future"
- ❌ Ignore the connection to electronic objects — your persona should need something

## Optional Enhancement: Cultural Probe

Want to go deeper? Create a fictional artifact from your world using one research methodology:

- **Diary Entry** — A week from your persona's diary
- **Interview Transcript** — A conversation with your persona
- **Photo Study** — A series of photos from their daily life (staged, drawn, or generated)
- **Observation Notes** — Researcher notes from "shadowing" your persona
- **Found Object** — A drawing/description of something your persona carries

## Grading Rubric

### Draft Rubric (Week 2) — Formative Feedback

| Criteria | Excellent | Good | Needs Work |
|----------|-----------|------|------------|
| **World Building** | Specific, vivid details that create a clear sense of place and context (3-5 concrete aspects) | Basic scenario described with some detail (2-3 aspects mentioned) | Vague or underdeveloped world concept |
| **Persona Development** | Detailed person with clear needs, routines, and characteristics relevant to their world | Basic persona with some detail but limited connection to world | Minimal persona development or generic character |
| **Speculative Thinking** | Creative, thoughtful future that goes beyond obvious tropes; internally consistent | Familiar future scenario with some original elements | Generic or contradictory future concept |
| **Visual Communication** | Includes compelling image(s) that enhance understanding of world or persona | Includes image but doesn't add much to understanding | Missing image or image unrelated to concept |
| **Writing & Clarity** | Clear, engaging writing; easy to understand the world and person | Adequate writing with some unclear moments | Confusing or poorly organized |

**Draft Purpose:** This is about getting your ideas out. Expect feedback on how to make your world and persona more specific and useful for design.

## Questions to Ask Yourself

Before submitting your final version:

1. Could someone else read this and clearly picture my world?
2. Does my persona feel like a real person, not a list of bullet points?
3. Is it clear what problem or opportunity exists for design?
4. Have I avoided clichés and really thought about what makes this future unique?
5. Do my images help tell the story?
6. Has my thinking evolved since the draft based on feedback?

## Getting Help

- **Office Hours:** Book time to discuss your world and persona if you're stuck
- **Class Discussion:** We'll workshop ideas together in Week 2
- **Peer Review:** Share drafts with classmates for feedback
- **Resources:**
  - `/assignments/utopia_dystopia/` folder for examples
  - `/assignments/personas/` folder for persona templates
  - Universal Methods of Design (available in library)

---

## Remember

The goal isn't to predict the future accurately. The goal is to create a rich, specific context that pushes you to design something meaningful. The weirder and more thoughtful your world is, the more interesting your final electronic object will be.

Have fun with this. Speculative design is permission to imagine.
