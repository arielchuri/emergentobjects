# Assembled Object

**Week:** Due Week 11
**Due:** Apr 20
**Weight:** Part of Final Emergent Object (20%)

## Learning Outcomes

This assignment maps to the following learning outcomes:

- **LO 1 - Critical Thinking:** Critically reflect on how the design and function of an electronic object challenge societal values or ecological sustainability.
- **LO 2 - Tools, Materials, Methods:** Write and debug basic Python code and create electronic circuits using microprocessors.
- **LO 3 - Experimentation:** Play with the concept of a "fantastic object" and experiment with non-traditional human-object interactions through play and discovery.

## Description

Complete the full assembly of your emergent object, integrating electronics, code, and enclosure into a functioning whole. This is the technical completion of your project before final polish and documentation.

## Requirements

- Fully assembled object with:
  - All electronic components properly installed and wired
  - Finalized, debugged code running on microcontroller
  - Enclosure complete and fitted
  - All interactions working as intended
  - Clean, organized internal wiring
  - Secure, safe assembly
- Object must be functional and demonstrable
- All soldered connections complete (if applicable)

## Deliverables

- Completed assembled object brought to class
- Working demonstration in class
- Brief in-class presentation (2-3 minutes) showing:
  - How it works
  - Key interactions
  - Any final adjustments needed

## Grading Rubric

This assignment is part of the **Final Emergent Object** (20% of final grade).

| Criteria | A (95-100%) | A- / B+ (87-94%) | B / B- (80-86%) | C+ / C (73-79%) | Below C (< 73%) |
|----------|-------------|------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Functionality (40%)** | All features work flawlessly; reliable and consistent operation; sophisticated interactions; robust performance; exceeds functional expectations; delightful to use and demonstrate | All features work well; reliable operation; good interactions; solid performance; meets functional expectations; works well for demonstration | Most features work adequately; mostly reliable; basic interactions function; acceptable performance; meets minimum functional expectations | Limited functionality; unreliable operation; problematic interactions; poor performance; below functional expectations | Non-functional or severely limited; doesn't work; cannot be demonstrated |
| **Assembly Quality (30%)** | Exceptional assembly; perfectly organized internals; flawless soldering (if used); excellent wire management; safe and professional; could be manufactured | Strong assembly; well-organized internals; good soldering; good wire management; safe and clean; professional appearance | Adequate assembly; acceptable organization; competent soldering; basic wire management; safe; reasonably well-done | Poor assembly; disorganized internals; weak soldering; poor wire management; safety concerns; sloppy appearance | Severely poor assembly; dangerous; failing connections; cannot be safely operated |
| **Technical Integration (20%)** | Perfect integration of electronics, code, and physical form; seamless operation; sophisticated systems thinking; all elements work in harmony; exemplary | Strong integration; good coordination of all elements; solid systems thinking; elements work well together; professional | Adequate integration; acceptable coordination; basic systems thinking; elements work together functionally | Poor integration; elements poorly coordinated; limited systems thinking; problematic interactions between parts | No meaningful integration; elements don't work together; system failures |
| **Completeness (10%)** | All planned elements fully implemented and polished; exceeds original vision; demonstrates thoroughness and commitment | All planned elements implemented; meets original vision; demonstrates good follow-through | Most planned elements implemented; mostly meets vision; demonstrates adequate completion | Many planned elements missing or incomplete; falls short of vision; limited completion | Severely incomplete; does not meet basic vision; minimal completion |

### In-Class Demonstration Requirements

- **Quality of assembly:** Care taken in construction
- **Reliability:** Works consistently and predictably
- **Safety:** Proper electrical practices followed
- **Readiness:** On track for successful final presentation

### What Happens Next
After this milestone:
- User testing (Week 12)
- Final polish and refinements (Week 13-14)
- Product photography
- Final presentation preparation (Week 14)
- Final presentation (Week 15)

### Getting Help
- Use Week 11 workshop for code debugging and wiring refinement
- Attend office hours for troubleshooting
- Test thoroughly before final presentation
- Document any remaining issues or needed adjustments

## Resources

- Workshop: Code debugging and wiring refinement - Week 11
- Workshop: Soldering and final assembly - Week 10
- Making Center technicians
- See soldering directory for techniques
- Troubleshooting guides (Canvas)

## Tips

- Test everything before final assembly
- Label wires and connections before installation
- Leave access for troubleshooting and adjustments
- Use cable ties or other wire management
- Double-check all connections before powering on
- Have backup plans if something doesn't work
- Bring to office hours if you need help
- Keep your code well-commented in case you need to debug
- Test power supply and battery life
- Make sure enclosure can be opened if needed later
