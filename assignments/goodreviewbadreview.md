# Good Review / Bad Review

Imagine a section of a webpage that highlights two user reveiws or testimonials of a product. You will create a jpg file showing two reviews of a fictional product. One review is positive and the other negative. Your reviews should be at least three paragraphs long.

You will write these reviews about a product of your own invention. You do not need to describe or name the product. In order to invent a product, imagin a our society in the future. This future society is either a *dystopia* or a *utopia*. Imagine the reasons that it is one or both of these things. Imagine a product that exists in that fictional society.
