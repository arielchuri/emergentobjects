**Week:** Assigned Week 3, Due Week 15
**Due:** May 12 (Final Presentation)
**Weight:** 20%

## Learning Outcomes

This assignment maps to ALL course learning outcomes:

- **LO 1 - Critical Thinking:** Critically reflect on how the design and function of an electronic object challenge societal values or ecological sustainability.
- **LO 2 - Tools, Materials, Methods:** Write and debug basic Python code and create electronic circuits using microprocessors.
- **LO 3 - Experimentation:** Play with the concept of a "fantastic object" and experiment with non-traditional human-object interactions through play and discovery.
- **LO 4 - Discipline Specific:** Apply design research methodologies and analyze user behaviors to develop detailed personas and user journeys.
- **LO 5 - Broad Application:** Use speculative scenarios to inspire creative problem-solving across art, design, and strategic thinking fields.
- **LO 6 - Life:** Reflect on personal responsibility and self-understanding through the creation of objects that respond to a utopian or dystopian future.
- **LO 7 - Reflection:** Document their process and reflect on their learning via the Parsons Learning Portfolio.
