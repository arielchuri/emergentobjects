# Enclosure Build

**Week:** Assigned Week 9, Due Week 11
**Due:** Apr 20
**Weight:** Part of Final Emergent Object (20%)

## Learning Outcomes

This assignment maps to the following learning outcomes:

- **LO 2 - Tools, Materials, Methods:** Write and debug basic Python code and create electronic circuits using microprocessors.
- **LO 3 - Experimentation:** Play with the concept of a "fantastic object" and experiment with non-traditional human-object interactions through play and discovery.

## Description

Build the physical enclosure for your emergent object. This housing should protect the electronics, enable intended interactions, and embody your design vision for the speculative scenario.

## Requirements

- Create a functional enclosure that:
  - Houses all electronic components safely
  - Provides access to inputs (buttons, sensors)
  - Allows visibility/access to outputs (LEDs, screens, speakers)
  - Can be opened for maintenance/debugging
  - Reflects your design aesthetic and concept
- Use appropriate materials and construction methods
- Ensure structural integrity and durability
- Consider user interaction and ergonomics

## Deliverables

- Completed physical enclosure
- Bring to class for review
- Upload photos to Canvas showing:
  - Exterior from multiple angles
  - Interior layout
  - Key construction details
  - Scale reference

## Grading Rubric

This assignment is part of the **Final Emergent Object** (20% of final grade).

| Criteria | A (95-100%) | A- / B+ (87-94%) | B / B- (80-86%) | C+ / C (73-79%) | Below C (< 73%) |
|----------|-------------|------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Functionality (35%)** | Perfect fit for all components; excellent access to all inputs/outputs; thoughtful wire routing; easy maintenance access; innovative functional solutions; exceeds expectations | Good fit for components; good access to inputs/outputs; adequate wire routing; reasonable maintenance access; solid functional design | Acceptable fit; adequate access; basic wire routing; some maintenance access; meets minimum functional requirements | Poor fit; limited access; problematic wire routing; difficult maintenance; functional issues | Doesn't fit components; no access; impossible maintenance; non-functional |
| **Craft Quality (30%)** | Exceptional craftsmanship; professional-level finish; flawless construction; exquisite attention to detail; museum-quality; beautiful | Strong craftsmanship; polished finish; clean construction; good attention to detail; professional appearance; attractive | Adequate craftsmanship; acceptable finish; competent construction; basic attention to detail; reasonably well-made | Poor craftsmanship; rough finish; sloppy construction; minimal attention to detail; looks unfinished | Severely poor craftsmanship; no finish; broken or failing construction |
| **Design Integration (20%)** | Enclosure brilliantly embodies concept; form perfectly serves function; exceptional consideration of user experience; innovative design solutions; enhances object meaning | Enclosure well-supports concept; form serves function well; good UX consideration; thoughtful design; supports object meaning | Enclosure adequately relates to concept; form serves basic function; acceptable UX; reasonable design; doesn't detract from concept | Enclosure weakly relates to concept; form barely serves function; poor UX; minimal design thought; detracts from concept | No meaningful design integration; form doesn't serve function; ignores UX and concept |
| **Structural Integrity (15%)** | Exceptionally sturdy and durable; perfect structural design; will withstand extensive use; professional engineering; robust | Strong and durable; good structural design; will withstand normal use; solid engineering; reliable | Adequately sturdy; acceptable structure; will survive basic use; competent engineering; functional | Weak structure; questionable durability; may not survive use; poor engineering; fragile | Structurally unsound; will not survive use; failing construction; dangerous |

### Required Deliverables Checklist

### Construction Quality Indicators
**Excellent enclosures demonstrate:**
- Clean, precise cuts and joins
- Smooth, finished surfaces
- Careful material selection
- Thoughtful details (rounded corners, etc.)
- Professional appearance
- Structural soundness
- User-friendly access

**Common issues to avoid:**
- Rough, unfinished edges
- Gaps and poor fit
- Weak joints
- Inadequate component access
- No finish or surface treatment
- Structural weakness

### Assessment Focus
- **Making skills:** Translating design into physical form
- **Problem-solving:** Working through construction challenges
- **Material understanding:** Appropriate techniques for materials
- **Integration:** Form and function working together
- **Finish:** Taking time for final quality

### Relationship to Final Grade
The enclosure is critical to final project success:
- Protects your electronics
- Enables intended interactions
- Communicates your design vision
- Demonstrates craft skill development
- Contributes to final presentation impact

## Resources

- Lecture: Cardboard Engineering - Week 7
- Demo: Enclosure building - Week 7
- Making Center resources and equipment
- See mechanical_drawing directory
- Enclosure examples in finalproject directory

## Tips

- Measure your components carefully and add tolerance
- Create templates or mockups before final construction
- Consider how users will hold and interact with the object
- Think about weight distribution and balance
- Plan for wire routing and access to microcontroller USB port
- Sand, finish, and paint for professional appearance
- Test fit components before final assembly
- Leave space for final adjustments
- Consider how the enclosure relates to your speculative scenario
