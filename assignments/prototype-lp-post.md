# Prototype Learning Portfolio Post

**Week:** Assigned Week 9, Due Week 9
**Due:** Apr 6
**Weight:** Part of Final Emergent Object (20%)

## Learning Outcomes

This assignment maps to the following learning outcomes:

- **LO 2 - Tools, Materials, Methods:** Write and debug basic Python code and create electronic circuits using microprocessors.
- **LO 3 - Experimentation:** Play with the concept of a "fantastic object" and experiment with non-traditional human-object interactions through play and discovery.
- **LO 7 - Reflection:** Document their process and reflect on their learning via the Parsons Learning Portfolio.

## Description

Document your working prototype of the emergent object, including the electronic functionality, code, and initial form. This is a progress checkpoint before final assembly.

## Requirements

- Working electronics with microcontroller
- Functioning code that demonstrates core interactions
- Documentation in Learning Portfolio including:
  - Photos/videos of prototype in action
  - Code snippets with explanations
  - Circuit documentation
  - Description of functionality (300-400 words)
  - Current challenges and next steps
  - Reflection on progress and learning

## Deliverables

- Complete Learning Portfolio post with:
  - Visual documentation (photos/video)
  - Working code posted or linked
  - Written reflection (300-400 words)
  - Circuit documentation
  - Description of current state and planned improvements

## Grading Rubric

### Required Documentation Checklist
- [ ] Photos of working prototype from multiple angles
- [ ] Video demonstration of interaction (recommended)
- [ ] Code posted or linked (with comments)
- [ ] Circuit documentation (diagram or photo with labels)
- [ ] Written description of current functionality (300-400 words)
- [ ] Discussion of current challenges
- [ ] Plan for next steps and improvements

### What Defines Success at This Stage
- **Working core functionality:** The essential interaction is functioning
- **Honest documentation:** Clear about what works and what doesn't
- **Problem-solving evidence:** Shows you're troubleshooting issues
- **Forward momentum:** Clear path from prototype to final
- **Learning reflection:** Understanding what you're discovering

### Common Challenges at This Stage
- Code/hardware integration issues
- Sensor reliability problems
- Power supply challenges
- Time management
- Scope adjustments

### Assessment Focus
This checkpoint emphasizes:
- **Progress over perfection:** You're showing development, not final work
- **Honest assessment:** Being real about status helps you succeed
- **Problem-solving:** Demonstrating you're working through challenges
- **Documentation practice:** Building portfolio presentation skills

## Resources

- Demo: Advanced Code Loops - Week 9
- Workshop: Final project troubleshooting - Week 9
- See microcontroller_intro and programming_2 directories
- Previous project examples in finalproject directory

## Tips

- Test your code and circuits thoroughly before documenting
- Take clear, well-lit photos from multiple angles
- Include video of interactions if possible
- Explain your code with comments and descriptions
- Be honest about what's working and what still needs work
- Document problems and solutions - this shows learning
- Ask for troubleshooting help in class workshop
- Keep backup copies of working code versions
