# Test Results Learning Portfolio Post

**Week:** Assigned Week 12, Due Week 13
**Due:** May 4
**Weight:** Part of Learning Portfolio engagement (10%)

## Learning Outcomes

This assignment maps to the following learning outcomes:

- **LO 4 - Discipline Specific:** Apply design research methodologies and analyze user behaviors to develop detailed personas and user journeys.
- **LO 7 - Reflection:** Document their process and reflect on their learning via the Parsons Learning Portfolio.

## Description

Conduct peer user testing sessions with your emergent object and document the results, insights, and implications for your project in a Learning Portfolio post.

## Requirements

- Conduct user testing with at least 3 people
- Document the testing process:
  - Testing protocol/script
  - Observations during testing
  - User feedback and quotes
  - Photos or video of testing sessions
- Analysis of findings (400-500 words):
  - What worked well
  - What surprised you
  - What needs improvement
  - How testing validated or challenged your assumptions
- Action items based on feedback

## Deliverables

- Complete Learning Portfolio post including:
  - Testing documentation (photos/video)
  - User feedback summary
  - Analysis and insights (400-500 words)
  - List of improvements made or planned

## Grading Rubric

This assignment is part of the **Learning Portfolio engagement** (10% of final grade).

| Criteria | A (95-100%) | A- / B+ (87-94%) | B / B- (80-86%) | C+ / C (73-79%) | Below C (< 73%) |
|----------|-------------|------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Testing Process (30%)** | Exceptional testing process; tests with 4+ diverse users; well-designed protocol; systematic approach; comprehensive observations; captures rich data; professional methodology | Strong testing process; tests with 3+ users; good protocol; organized approach; solid observations; captures useful data; good methodology | Adequate testing process; tests with 3 users; acceptable protocol; basic approach; reasonable observations; captures basic data | Minimal testing; tests with fewer than 3 or rushed; weak protocol; disorganized; limited observations; insufficient data | No meaningful testing; inadequate user involvement; no protocol; no useful data |
| **Documentation (25%)** | Exceptional documentation; comprehensive photos/video of testing; detailed observations; captures verbatim quotes; excellent notes; professional presentation; rich qualitative data | Strong documentation; good photos/video; thorough observations; includes quotes; good notes; well-presented; solid qualitative data | Adequate documentation; acceptable visual records; basic observations; some quotes; sufficient notes; reasonably presented | Weak documentation; poor visual records; minimal observations; few quotes; limited notes; poorly presented | Missing or severely inadequate documentation |
| **Analysis (25%)** | Exceptional analysis (400-500 words); deep, insightful interpretation; identifies patterns and themes; demonstrates sophisticated thinking; connects findings to design decisions; excellent synthesis | Strong analysis; thoughtful interpretation; identifies key patterns; demonstrates solid thinking; connects to design; good synthesis | Adequate analysis; acceptable interpretation; identifies some patterns; demonstrates basic thinking; makes some connections | Minimal analysis; superficial interpretation; misses patterns; demonstrates limited thinking; weak connections | No meaningful analysis; no interpretation; no pattern recognition |
| **Insights (20%)** | Exceptional insights from user perspectives; profound learning about design and users; challenges assumptions; identifies surprising findings; demonstrates growth; actionable recommendations | Strong insights; meaningful learning; good user perspective; recognizes surprises; shows growth; useful recommendations | Adequate insights; acceptable learning; some user perspective; recognizes basic findings; shows some growth | Minimal insights; limited learning; little user perspective; misses important findings; minimal growth | No meaningful insights; no learning demonstrated; ignores user feedback |

### Effective User Testing Practices
**Before testing:**
- Prepare your object so it works reliably
- Create a brief testing script for consistency
- Set up documentation method (notes, recording)
- Choose diverse testers if possible

**During testing:**
- Brief introduction without over-explaining
- Let users interact with minimal instruction
- Observe without defending or explaining
- Ask open-ended questions
- Pay attention to non-verbal reactions
- Take thorough notes

**After testing:**
- Compile and organize feedback
- Look for patterns across testers
- Identify surprises and contradictions
- Consider what insights will improve work

### Analysis Quality Indicators
**Strong analysis demonstrates:**
- Synthesis across multiple testers
- Pattern recognition
- Insight into user experience
- Honesty about what didn't work
- Specific, actionable improvements
- Reflection on assumptions

**Weak analysis shows:**
- Just listing what happened
- No synthesis or patterns
- Defensive responses to criticism
- Vague or generic observations
- No specific improvements identified

### Assessment Focus
- **User-centered learning:** Learning from actual users
- **Open-mindedness:** Being receptive to feedback
- **Critical thinking:** Analyzing what feedback means
- **Design iteration:** Using insights to improve work

### Connection to Final Project
User testing informs:
- Last-minute refinements before final presentation
- Understanding of how others experience your work
- Validation of design decisions
- Stories for final presentation
- Future improvement opportunities

## Resources

- Lecture: Product Photography - Week 12
- Workshop: Peer User Testing - Week 12
- User testing methodologies (Canvas)
- Testing protocol templates

## Tips

- Prepare your object so it works reliably
- Create a brief script to guide testing consistently
- Let users interact without too much instruction
- Take notes or video during testing
- Ask open-ended questions about their experience
- Pay attention to non-verbal reactions
- Don't defend your work - just observe and listen
- Thank participants for honest feedback
- Look for patterns across multiple testers
- Consider what insights will improve your final presentation
